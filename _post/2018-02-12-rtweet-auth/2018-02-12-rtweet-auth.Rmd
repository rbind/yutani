Since the version 0.6.0 (published on Nov 16, 2017), [rtweet package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rtweet) **no longer requires the users to create their own apps**. Did you notice? I didn't know this until the author, Michael W. Kearney, kindly answered to [my silly question on GitHub](https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet/issues/167). I really appreciate that he is always eager not only to maintain the code but also to communicate with lazy users like me.

Then, I did a quick poll (sorry, in Japanese) about how well known is the fact. The result is here; 91% of people don't know about this coolness! So, I am motivated to write a post about how easy rtweet package is now :)

## All we need to start rtweet package is...

literally this:

> NEW: All you need is a Twitter account and rtweet and you're up and running!
(https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet/tree/7e106d6344d2f816c42365401152d60d1c92bd54#usage)

### Step1: Create a Twitter account

(I think you can skip this step; I bet you are Twitter-addicted already, given that you are interested in the data about Twitter, right...?)

### Step2: Install rtweet package

Install the package from CRAN as usual:

```r
install.packages("rtweet")
```

### Step3: Use whatever function of rtweet you like

If the function invokes the API calls and it is the first time you run such kind of functions, the browser will be launched to ask for your permission. For example:

```r
tw <- search_tweets("#rstats", include_rts = FALSE)
```

And, all you need to do is just click "Authorise app" button on the browser.

Now, the token is aquired and saved in `~/.rtweet_token.rds`, which will be automatically used from the next time. That's all!

Super easy!

## (Yet, you need your own app in some cases)

As you notice the screenshot above, the default app embeded in rtweet package has read-only permission. So, if you want to do further actions like tweeting and following/unfollowing, you need to create your own app.
