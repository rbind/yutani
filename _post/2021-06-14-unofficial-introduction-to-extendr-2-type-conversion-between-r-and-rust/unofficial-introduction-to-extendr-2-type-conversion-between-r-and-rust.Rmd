```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(rextendr)
```

[extendr](https://github.com/extendr/extendr) is a project that provides
an interface between R and Rust. In [the last
post](../2021-06-06-unofficial-introduction-to-extendr-1-your-first-r-package-with-rust/),
I explained about how to create an R package with extendr briefly. This
time, we'll walk though how to handle various R types.

## Vector

Let's start with the last example in the last post.

```{extendrsrc add}
#[extendr]
fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}
```

While this works perfectly fine with a single value, this fails when the
length is more than one.

```{r add_error, error=TRUE}
add(1:2, 2:3)
```

This is very easy to fix. In Rust, we can use
[`Vec<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html) to
represent a vector of values of type `T`.

```{extendrsrc add2}
// I don't explain much about the Rust code this time, but, for now, please don't
// worry if you can't understand what it does at the moment. Probably it's not
// very important to understand this post. Move forward.

#[extendr]
fn add2(x: Vec<i32>, y: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    x.iter().enumerate().map(|(i, x)| x + y[i]).collect()
}
```

```{r add_success}
add2(1:2, 2:3)
```

Easy!

### Wait, didn't you say we can't do this...!?

Some of you might remember, in [this
post](https://yutani.rbind.io/post/some-more-notes-about-using-rust-code-in-r-packages/#passing-a-vector-from-rust-to-r-or-vice-versa),
I wrote

> We cannot simply pass a variable length of vector

from R to Rust.

Yeah, it's true it was too difficult because I was struggling to do it
*via FFI*! There's no metadata available about the length or the
structure of the data by default. But, with extendr, we can seamlessly
access these metadata *via R's C API*. So, in short, extendr was the
game changer.

## `NA`

One more caveat about `add()` is that this cannot handle a missing
value, `NA`.

```{r add_error2, error=TRUE}
add(1L, NA)
```

In Rust, we can use
[`Option<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html) to
represent an optional, or possibly missing, value.

```{extendrsrc add3}
// pattern match is one of the most powerful things in Rust, btw!

#[extendr]
fn add3(x: Option<i32>, y: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
    match (x, y) {
        (Some(x), Some(y)) => Some(x + y),
        _ => NA_INTEGER
    }
}
```

This function can handle `NA`.

```{r}
add3(1L, 2L)
add3(1L, NA)
```

It might be safe to always use `Option` since there's always possibility
that R value can be `NA` by nature. But, we might want to choose
non-`Option` version to avoid the overhead (c.f. [How much overhead is
there with Options and Results? - The Rust Programming Language
Forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/how-much-overhead-is-there-with-options-and-results/37327)),
so it depends.

## Primitive types

Okay, let's learn about the primitive types at last. Here's the
corresponding table of R types and Rust types. We don't have the direct
equivalent of `factor` and `complex` here, but let's talk about it
later.

+-----------+--------+
| R         | Rust   |
+===========+========+
| `integer` | `i32`  |
+-----------+--------+
| `numeric` | `f64`  |
+-----------+--------+
| `logical` | `bool` |
+-----------+--------+
| `c        | `S     |
| haracter` | tring` |
|           |        |
|           | `&str` |
+-----------+--------+
| `factor`  | \-     |
+-----------+--------+
| `complex` | \-     |
+-----------+--------+

### `integer` and `numeric`

`integer` and `numeric` can mainly be converted into `i32` and `f64`
respectively. I used "mainly" because it's not that strict. They both
can be converted into either of:

-   `u8`
-   `u16`
-   `u32`
-   `u64`
-   `i8`
-   `i16`
-   `i32`
-   `i64`
-   `f32`
-   `f64`

So, in other words, if you don't want to prevent from numeric values are
coerced into integers, you'll need to check the types by yourself.

### `logical`

`logical` is translated from/into `bool`. That's all.

### `character`

`character` is a bit tricky in that you can convert it to either of
`String` and `&str`. You'll probably have to scratch your head to
understand the concept of "lifetime" to choose the proper one
(confession: I still don't understand it). But, in short,

-   `String` : choose this when you modify the content strings

-   `&str`: choose this (probably with `'static` lifetime) when you only
    reference the strings

If you are not familiar with Rust yet, I recommend you to start with
`String`. `String` is copied around so you might have unnecessary
overhead, but it's generally easier to handle because we need to think
about the lifetimes less frequently.

### `factor`

To put things simpler, until this point, I deliberately chose the cases
when we have the corresponding types in Rust's side. But, `factor` isn't
the case. It cannot be directly converted into a simple Rust type (at
least at the moment). Instead, it can be cast into
[`StrItr`](https://extendr.github.io/extendr/extendr_api/iter/struct.StrIter.html).
`StrItr` is a "proxy" to the underlying data on R's side.

I'll try explaining this in another post, but keep in mind that extendr
provides that "proxy"-type of interface as well as the simple conversion
to Rust's primitive types.

## `list`

A `list` can be converted into
[`HashMap<String, Robj>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html).
[`Robj`](https://extendr.github.io/extendr/extendr_api/robj/enum.Robj.html)
is also a "proxy," which contains arbitrary R data.

```{extendrsrc print_a_fun}
#[extendr]
fn print_a(x: HashMap<String, Robj>) {
    println!("{:?}", x.get("a"));
}
```

```{r print_a}
print_a(list(a = 1, b = 2))
print_a(list(b = 2))
```

[`r!`](https://extendr.github.io/extendr/extendr_api/macro.r.html) is a
macro to create an R object from a Rust expression, by the way.

## `Robj`?

As a sneak peak of the next post, let's take a look at the usage of
`Robj`.

So far, I created only functions that accepts just one type. What if we
want to create a function that accepts multiple types of arguments? In
this case, we can create a function that takes `Robj` as its argument
and convert it by ourselves. `Robj` has many methods `as_XXX()` to
convert to (or, more precisely, extract and copy the value of R object,
and turn it into) a type. Here, let's use `as_integer()` to generate
`Option<i32>` .

```{extendrsrc robj}
#[extendr]
fn int(x: Robj) -> Option<i32> {
    x.as_integer()
}
```

```{r as_int}
# integer
int(1L)

# not integer-ish
int("foo")
```

## What's next?

In this post, I focused mainly the Rust's side of the type ecosystem.
Next, I probably need to write about more R-ish things like
[`Function`](https://extendr.github.io/extendr/extendr_api/wrapper/function/struct.Function.html)
or
[`Symbol`](https://extendr.github.io/extendr/extendr_api/wrapper/symbol/struct.Symbol.html)
, which I need some time to understand correctly. Stay tuned...
