I've been struggling with `configure.win` for several days. I think I've done,
but it seems I've come too far from [the last post](https://yutani.rbind.io/post/2021-08-01-unofficial-introduction-to-extendr-appendix-i-setup-github-actions-ci-and-more/#provide-precompiled-binaries-for-windows). So, let me try to explain what a `configure.win` (or
`configure`) would look like.

Let's start with this `Makevars.win`, basically the same one on the last blog post.

``` makefile
CRATE = string2path
BASE_TAG = windows_20210801-3

TARGET = $(subst 64,x86_64,$(subst 32,i686,$(WIN)))-pc-windows-gnu
LIBDIR = ./rust/target/$(TARGET)/release
STATLIB = $(LIBDIR)/libstring2path.a
PKG_LIBS = -L$(LIBDIR) -lstring2path -lws2_32 -ladvapi32 -luserenv

# c.f. https://stackoverflow.com/a/34756868
CARGO_EXISTS := $(shell cargo --version 2> /dev/null)

all: C_clean

$(SHLIB): $(STATLIB)

$(STATLIB):
ifdef CARGO_EXISTS
	cargo build --target=$(TARGET) --lib --release --manifest-path=./rust/Cargo.toml
else
	mkdir -p $(LIBDIR)
	curl -L -o $(STATLIB) https://github.com/yutannihilation/$(CRATE)/releases/download/$(BASE_TAG)/$(TARGET)-lib$(CRATE).a
endif

C_clean:
	rm -Rf $(SHLIB) $(STATLIB) $(OBJECTS)

clean:
	rm -Rf $(SHLIB) $(STATLIB) $(OBJECTS) rust/target
```

## Tweak `Makevars.win`

Before talking about configure scripts, I have to write a bit about `Makevars.win`
(and `Makevars`) because it has something to be fixed.

### Set `CARGO_HOME`

Can you see what part is wrong in the above `Makevars.win`? After the first CRAN
submission of this package, I got this reply:

> Checking this creates ~/.cargo sized 82MB, in violation of the CRAN Policy.
> Please fix as necessary and resubmit.

[The CRAN Policy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html) says:

> - Packages should not write in the user’s home filespace (including clipboards), 
>   nor anywhere else on the file system apart from the R session’s temporary directory 
>   (or during installation in the location pointed to by TMPDIR: and such usage should be cleaned up).

By default, `cargo` uses `~/.cargo` for caching various things like the crates.io 
index and the dependency crates. Apparently, this is not allowed. To avoid this,
we can set `CARGO_HOME` to the package's local directory, like [gifski package
does](https://github.com/r-rust/gifski/blob/6b86cc6b60abbc2294db821f27cae37413df70c2/src/Makevars#L10).

``` makefile
export CARGO_HOME=$(PWD)/.cargo
```

Alternatively, we can set this on the head of the line of `cargo build` directly.

``` makefile
CARGO_HOME=$(PWD)/.cargo

...snip...

  CARGO_HOME=$(PWD)/.cargo cargo build --target=$(TARGET) --lib --release --manifest-path=./rust/Cargo.toml
```

In addition to this, as it "should be cleaned up," we also need to add these two lines
after `cargo build`:

``` makefile
	rm -Rf $(CARGO_HOME)
	rm -Rf $(LIBDIR)/build
```

But, this is a bit painful in terms of development. Why do I need to compile
it always from scratch even on my local??

### `NOT_CRAN` environmental variable

Fortunately, devtools utilities provide `NOT_CRAN` envvar to distinguish CRAN
and other environment. So, maybe we can determine whether to set `CARGO_HOME`,
depending on `NON_CRAN`. It would be:

``` makefile
# An envvar cannot be referred to as $(NOT_CRAN)
NOT_CRAN_ENVVAR = ${NOT_CRAN}

$(STATLIB):
ifeq ($(NOT_CRAN_ENVVAR),"true")
  cargo build --target=$(TARGET) --lib --release --manifest-path=./rust/Cargo.toml
else
  CARGO_HOME=$(PWD)/.cargo cargo build --target=$(TARGET) --lib --release --manifest-path=./rust/Cargo.toml
	rm -Rf $(CARGO_HOME)
	rm -Rf $(LIBDIR)/build
endif
```

### Set `PATH`

One more thing my `Makevars` (not `Makevars.win` this time) couldn't covered
was the case when `cargo` is on `PATH` but `rustc` is not. It seems gifski package
handles this by including `$(HOME)/.cargo/bin` in `PATH` ([Makevars](https://github.com/r-rust/gifski/blob/6b86cc6b60abbc2294db821f27cae37413df70c2/src/Makevars#L13)).

I think sourcing `"$(HOME)/.cargo/env"` should also work (this actually just sets
`PATH`), so I'll try this next time. Note that `source` is not available on dash,
so use `.` for this.

``` sh
. "$(HOME)/.cargo/env" && cargo build ...
```

Okay, done. Let's move onto configure scripts.

## What is a configure script?

A configure script is often used for configuring `Makefile` or `Makevars`,
depending on the user's setup.

[Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#Configure-and-cleanup) says:

> If your package needs some system-dependent configuration before installation
> you can include an executable (Bourne shell script `configure` in your package
> which (if present) is executed by `R CMD INSTALL` before any other action is 
> performed. 

`configure` is executed on UNIX-alikes, and Windows uses a different file `configure.win`[^ucrt].
Actually, I got this request from CRAN:

[^ucrt]: There's also [`configure.ucrt`](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2021-September/081093.html), but you can forget this for now.

> By the way, ideally string2path would use configure to test for cargo

So far, I used `Makevars.win` for testing the existence of `cargo`, but it seems
configure scripts are the better place for this. Moreover, I do want to check the
cargo functionality more precisely, for example,

* if the Rust version is not too old to support ("MSRV")
* (Windows only) if the Rust installation has the required toolchain, `stable-msvc`
* (Windows only) if the Rust installation has the required targets, `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` and `i686-pc-windows-gnu`

but `Makevars.win` is a bit too narrow to write a complex shell script.

## `Biarch: true`

If we use `configure.win`, we have to add the following line to `DESCRIPTION`.

```
Biarch: true
```

Otherwise, the 32-bit version won't get built for unknown reason and it makes CRAN angry.
This behaviour is found on [R for Windows FAQ](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-build-my-package-for-both-32_002d-and-64_002dbit-R_003f),
but it doesn't explain what we should do. I found this on the following post on
RStudio Community.

* <https://community.rstudio.com/t/configure-win-and-cran-submission/24684/4>

## Check `cargo`

### Check `cargo` is installed

This is simple.

``` sh
cargo version >/dev/null 2>&1
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "cargo command is not available"
  exit 1
fi
```

Note that we don't want to exit here, because the absence of `cargo` isn't the
end of the world; there might be a precompiled binary for the platform. But,
let's tweak it later.

### Check if the Rust version is not too old to support

This isn't always necessary, but we might want to reject the older Rust in the
case when we use some feature that is available after the specific version of Rust.
You know, comparing versions is tricky. But, this can be archived by `sort`
command with `-V` option and `-C` option (c.f. [SO answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/567537)).
`-V` means version sort. `-C` means checking if the input is already sorted,
and errors when it's not. In summary, the implementation is the following:

```sh
# c.f. https://github.com/ron-rs/ron/issues/256#issuecomment-657999081
MIN_RUST_VERSION="1.41.0"

RUST_VERSION="`cargo --version | cut -d' ' -f2`"
if ! printf '%s\n' "${MIN_RUST_VERSION}" "${RUST_VERSION}" | sort -C -V; then
  echo "The installed version of cargo (${RUST_VERSION}) is older than the requirement (${MIN_RUST_VERSION})"
  exit 1
fi
```

(Btw, did you know we cannot use `$(expr)` notation in `configure` because
this syntax isn't available on Solaris? We need to use `` `expr` `` instead)

### Check if the Rust installation has the required toolchain and targets (Windows only)

On Windows, extendr provides support only the specified set of toolchain and
target. So, we need to check it.

Checking toolchain is simple. Use `+` to specify the toolchain.

``` sh
EXPECTED_TOOLCHAIN="stable-msvc"

cargo "+${EXPECTED_TOOLCHAIN}" version >/dev/null 2>&1
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "${EXPECTED_TOOLCHAIN} toolchain is not installed"
  exit 1
fi
```

Installed targets can be listed by `rustup target list --installed`.
So, the check would be like

``` sh
EXPECTED_TARGET="x86_64-pc-windows-gnu"

if ! rustup target list --installed | grep -q "${EXPECTED_TARGET}"; then
  echo "target ${EXPECTED_TARGET} is not installed"
  exit 1
fi
```

One thing tricky here is that, unlike `Makevars.win`, `configure.win` is
executed only once, not per architecture. So, we need to manually enumerate
both 64-bit and 32-bit.

One more tricky thing at the time of writing this is..., you might not notice,
the 32-bit version no longer exists in R-devel, which is supposed to be
released as R 4.2! So, we want to check 32-bit only when there's 32-bit. How?
I couldn't come up with some nice way, but it seems check on `${R_HOME}/bin/i386/`
works:

``` sh
check_cargo_target() {
  EXPECTED_TARGET="$1"
  
  if ! rustup target list --installed | grep -q "${EXPECTED_TARGET}"; then
    echo "target ${EXPECTED_TARGET} is not installed"
    exit 1
  fi
}

check_cargo_target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

if [ -d "${R_HOME}/bin/i386/" ]; then
  check_cargo_target i686-pc-windows-gnu
fi
```

## But what can we do?

Now we can check the `cargo` installation. But, if the check fails, what should
we do? Actually, on CRAN, Windows and macOS machines don't have Rust installed.

There are two options.

1. Install `cargo` into the temporary directory
2. Download the precompiled binaries (which means you have to serve the binaries on somewhere beforehand).

For example, the gifski package uses option 1 for macOS and option 2 for Windows.
My string2path package now uses option 2 both for macOS and for Windows.

## Install `cargo` on the fly

[The implementation for macOS](https://github.com/r-rust/gifski/blob/6b86cc6b60abbc2294db821f27cae37413df70c2/configure#L11-L12) is below.
The actual process is written in the downloaded script, but what it does is basically downloading `cargo`.

``` sh
# Try local version on MacOS, otherwise error
[ `uname` = "Darwin" ] && curl "https://autobrew.github.io/scripts/rust" -sSf | sh && exit 0
```

I don't write much about this this time, but [cargo package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cargo) should also be useful for this strategy.

## Download the precompiled binaries

This is what was done in `Makevars.win`.

```
$(STATLIB):
ifdef CARGO_EXISTS
	cargo build --target=$(TARGET) --lib --release --manifest-path=./rust/Cargo.toml
else
	mkdir -p $(LIBDIR)
	curl -L -o $(STATLIB) https://github.com/yutannihilation/$(CRATE)/releases/download/$(BASE_TAG)/$(TARGET)-lib$(CRATE).a
endif
```

To move this to `configure` and `configure.win`. There are several things to consider.
For example:

* As this downloads the binary before `$(STATLIB)` is executed, we need some tweak to ensure it's not removed by `C_clean`
* (Windows only) unlike `Makevars.win` is executed per arch, `configure.win` is executed only once

What's more, I want to make one addition:

* Verify the checksums

Some might have wondered if it's safe to download an arbitrary binary from GitHub.
First of all, I'd argue it's safe. To say the least, essentially, it's no unsafer
than downloading a cargo binary itself, (or than "`curl URL | sh`").
If it's downloaded over HTTPS, the data hardly gets compromised as long as their
servers are not compromised. I believe GitHub servers and Rust servers are both
very secure.

That said, we can improve the security further by "pinning" the binary. So, I
recommend verifying the checksum when downloading a binary. For example, [the 
stringi package does this](https://github.com/gagolews/stringi/blob/60ac05ecbc71aa49dd1f8137453b0f466728c787/R/install.R#L120).

### `Makevars.in` and `Makevars.win.in`

Remember `Makevars.win` has these lines (`$(STATLIB)` is the artifact of the Rust code):

``` makefile
all: C_clean
```
```makefile
C_clean:
	rm -Rf $(SHLIB) $(STATLIB) $(OBJECTS)
```

Removing `$(STATLIB)` is needed to invoke `cargo build` in the case when
`cargo` is installed. Otherwise, `$(STATLIB)` keeps existing, which means
that target is never executed.

On the other hand, we don't want to execute `cargo build` if there's no `cargo`.
So, in this case, we need to prevent the downloaded binary from getting removed.

In order to change the logic like this, we can use `Makevars.in` and `Makevars.win.in`
as a template to generate `Makevars` and `Makevars.win` respectively. Generating
these files can be done in `configure` and `configure.win`. For example,

`Makevars.in`:
```makefile
C_clean:
	rm -Rf $(SHLIB) $(OBJECTS) @CLEAN_EXTRA@
```

`configure`:
```makefile
# cargo installed
sed -e 's|@CLEAN_EXTRA@|$(STATLIB)|' src/Makevars.in > src/Makevars

# no cargo
sed -e 's|@CLEAN_EXTRA@||' src/Makevars.in > src/Makevars
```

If we generate `Makevars` and `Makevars.win` in configure scripts, we also need
to clean up these by the `cleanup` script (this is required by Writing R Extensions).

``` sh
rm -f src/Makevars src/Makevars.win
```

Of course, don't forget to add `src/Makevars` and `src/Makevars.win` to `.gitignore`.

(Probably, we can generate more sophisticated `Makevars`, but this time I used
only this one replacement.)

### Verify the checksums

To verify the checksum, we can use `sha256sum` on platforms other than macOS,
and `shasum -a 256` on macOS. For the example of macOS:

``` sh
SHA256SUM_EXPECTED=be65f074cb7ae50e5784e7650f48579fff35f30ff663d1c01eabdc9f35c1f87c

# Verify the checksum
SHA256SUM_ACTUAL=`shasum -a 256 "${DST}" | cut -d' ' -f1`
if [ -z "${SHA256SUM_ACTUAL}" ]; then
  echo "Failed to get the checksum"
  exit 1
fi

if [ "${SHA256SUM_ACTUAL}" != "${SHA256SUM_EXPECTED}" ]; then
  echo "Checksum mismatch for the pre-compiled binary"
  exit 1
fi
```


## [MOST IMPORTANT!] Ask CRAN maintainers to exclude Solaris

Oh, sorry, I forgot to enumerate the most important option!

0. Give up

Because 32-bit Solaris is not a supported platform by Rust, there's no option
other than giving up. I wrote this on cran-comment and it seems accepted:

> I would like to request to exclude Solaris from the build targets because Solaris is not a supported platform by Rust. This should be in line with the treatments of other CRAN packages that use Rust; gifski, baseflow, and salso are not built on Solaris. I'm sorry that I didn't write this in the first submission.

Be sure to add these comments when you submit an R package with Rust to CRAN!

## Example

For a real example, please refer to string2path, though your mileage may vary.
