    "text": "Passing a vector from Rust to R, or vice versa\n(Update: this code is incomplete, please read the next section as well)\nIt took me some time to figure out how to handle arrays. I’m still not confident if I understand this correctly, but let me try to explain…\nWe cannot simply pass a variable length of vector to FFI because the length is not known. So, what we need to do is obvious; pass the data with the length at the same time. To do this, we need to define the same struct both in C and in Rust.\nSuppose we want to implement a function that takes one double vector and reverse it.\nIn api.h, let’s define a struct named Slice:\ntypedef struct\n{\n  double *data;  // since we want to process `REALSXP` here, the data type is `double`\n  uint32_t len;\n} Slice;\nand in Rust code define the same one. #[repr(C)] means “do what C does.” This is needed to match the alignment of the field with C.\nuse std::os::raw::{c_double, c_uint};\n\n#[repr(C)]\npub struct Slice {\n    data: *mut c_double,\n    len: c_uint,\n}\n\nR code\nThe R code is pretty simple.\nrev &lt;- function(x) {\n  x &lt;- as.double(x)\n  .Call(rev_wrapper, x)\n}\n\n\nC code\nWe need to allocate a REALSXP vector and copy the result into it.\nSEXP rev_wrapper(SEXP x){\n  Slice s = {REAL(x), Rf_length(x)};\n  Slice s_rev = rev_slice(s);\n\n  SEXP out = PROTECT(Rf_allocVector(REALSXP, s_rev.len));\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; s_rev.len; i++) {\n    SET_REAL_ELT(out, i, s_rev.data[i]);\n  }\n  UNPROTECT(1);\n\n  return out;\n}\n\n\nRust code\nTo convert the Slice into Rust’s slice, we can use std::slice::from_raw_parts_mut. This is unsafe operation, so it needs to be wrapped with unsafe.\nslice and vector can be converted into an unsafe pointer by as_mut_ptr().\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern fn rev_slice(s: Slice) -&gt; Slice {\n    // convert from Slice to Rust slice\n    let s = unsafe { std::slice::from_raw_parts_mut(s.data, s.len as _) };\n\n    let mut v = s.to_vec();\n    v.reverse();\n    let len = v.len();\n\n    let v_ptr = v.as_mut_ptr();\n    std::mem::forget(v);\n\n    Slice {\n        data: v_ptr,\n        len: len as _,\n    }\n}\n\n\nResult\nYou can view the diff here:\nhttps://github.com/r-rust/hellorust/commit/e278d1541301ae18446bf1149a15d7aed868bd51"

    "text": "Update: free the Rust-allocated memory\nThe code above works, but I noticed the memory is never freed. Yes, that’s because I forgot to free it. This was my nice lesson to learn that Rust is not always automatically saving me from doing silly things :P\nOf course we can free it, but it’s a bit tricky. Since Slice is allocated by Rust, it needs to be freed by Rust (c.f. How to return byte array from Rust function to FFI C? - help - The Rust Programming Language Forum). (IIUC, if the length is known in advance, it might be good idea to allocate on C’s side and pass it to the Rust, as the answer on the forum above suggests. rev() is the case, but let me explain the different one for now…)\n\nRust code\nLet’s define a Rust function to free the memory. Box::from_raw() constructs a Box, a pointer for heap allocation, from the raw pointer. After that, the raw pointer is owned by the box, which means it’s now Rust’s role to destruct it and free the memory.\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn free_slice(s: Slice) {\n    // convert to Rust slice\n    let s = unsafe { std::slice::from_raw_parts_mut(s.data, s.len as _) };\n    let s = s.as_mut_ptr();\n    unsafe {\n        Box::from_raw(s);\n    }\n}\nI still don’t understand how to use Box properly, but it seems Sized structs can be handled simpler using Box in the argument: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/index.html#memory-layout\n\n\nC code\nCall the function above from C to free the memory as soon as it’s no longer in use.\n// Need to include to use memcpy()\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\n// ...snip...\n\nSEXP rev_wrapper(SEXP x){\n  Slice s = {REAL(x), Rf_length(x)};\n  Slice s_rev = rev_slice(s);\n\n  SEXP out = PROTECT(Rf_allocVector(REALSXP, s_rev.len));\n  memcpy(REAL(out), s_rev.data, s.len * sizeof(double));\n  free_slice(s_rev); // free!!!\n  UNPROTECT(1);\n\n  return out;\n}\n\n\nResult\nThe full diff is here:\nhttps://github.com/r-rust/hellorust/commit/97b3628b4a66eae9e25898a79ebf20fa59741063\n\n\nCan I do zero-copy?\nCopying memory to memory is not very cool, but it just works. I don’t know any nicer way yet. Apache Arrow seems a overkill for this simple usage, but will I need it in future…? Or flatbuffer? This seems a battle for another day, so I’ll stop here for now."

I was searching for some alternative of Processing, a great creative coding framework, and I found nannou. At first, I didn’t expect I needed to learn Rust seriously, as the framework wraps the things very nicely. But, since nannou is still maturing, I found I needed to dive a bit deeper into the world of Rust to make things work on my environment. I’m now learning wgpu, a Rust implementation of WebGPU.

Consider the case when we multi-spread()ing one column:\n\n# an example in ?tidyr::spread\ndf &lt;- tibble(x = c(\"a\", \"b\"), y = c(3, 4), z = c(5, 6))\n\nspread_bundles(df, key = x, y, simplify = FALSE)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n      z   a$y   b$y\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     5     3    NA\n2     6    NA     4\n\n\nSince y is the only one column in the data, we can simplify these 1-column data.frames to vectors:\n\nspread_bundles(df, key = x, y, simplify = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n      z     a     b\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     5     3    NA\n2     6    NA     4\n\n\nThis is usual spread().\nI’m yet to see if we can improve the current spread() and gather() to handle these differences transparently…"

But, different languages have different error handling mechanism, and it might not work well to attempt to free resources beyond the language boundaries.\nIn order to solve this problem, R’s C API provices R_UnwindProtect(), which allows us to call a custom cleanup function before aborting. C++ can utilize this to delay R’s stack unwinding by escaping from it by longjmp and then resuming by another API, R_ContinueUnwind(). But, as Rust desn’t support longjmp, Rust cannot implement such a custom cleanup function. So, I concluded that, while it’s not totally safe, we have no choice but to use panic!() to escape from R_UnwindProtect().\nHowever, I was wrong."

The continuous token for R_ContinueUnwind() to the C’s side.\nYou might wonder what’s “the C’s side” mean, especially if you are familiar with extendr framework. Yes, Rust functions can be called directly from R via FFI if compiled so. However, to handle exceptions properly, we must use a C wrapper function to call R_ContinueUnwind().\n\nOne more thing that might be confusing is that we are going to write two C functions:\n\nC function to be called from Rust (i.e., a wrapper around R_UnwindProtect()).\nC function to be called from R session (i.e., a wrapper to inspect and handle the result from the Rust function)"

    "title": "Don’t panic!, We Can Unwind On Rust",
    "section": "Implementation",
    "text": "Implementation\n\nC function to be called from Rust\nFirst, write a wrapper function of R_UnwindProtect(). The most of the code is derived from cpp11, so you can read cpp11 for the details.\n#include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;\n\n#include &lt;Rinternals.h&gt;\n\nvoid not_so_long_jump(void *jmpbuf, Rboolean jump) {\n    if (jump == TRUE) {\n        longjmp(*(jmp_buf *)jmpbuf, 1);\n    }\n}\n\nSEXP unwind_protect_impl(SEXP (*fun)(void *data), void *data) {\n    SEXP token = R_MakeUnwindCont();\n    R_PreserveObject(token);\n\n    jmp_buf jmpbuf;\n    if (setjmp(jmpbuf)) {\n        // Tag the pointer\n        return (SEXP)((uintptr_t)token | 1);\n    }\n\n    SEXP res = R_UnwindProtect(fun, data, not_so_long_jump, &jmpbuf, token);\n\n    // Note: cpp11 says we need SETCAR(token, R_NilValue) here, but \n    // let's ignore it for now for simplicity.\n\n    return res;\n}\n\nTagged pointer\nYou might wonder what | 1 does. This is a trick called “tagged pointer”, using a few of the least significant bits to store additional information. This time, the implementation uses the lowest bit as an error flag. tagged pointer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_pointer\nOf course, tagged pointer is not the only answer. For example, you can probably define a struct or enum to share the definition between Rust and C. But, I use tagged SEXP because it’s simpler in the sense it doesn’t require additional allocation.\nAlso note that I could just return Result here and create the tagged SEXP later. It’s just a matter of preferences.\n\n\nbuild.rs\nThis C function needs to be compiled before compiling the Rust code because it’s needed at the linking stage. We can use cc crate to compile it in the build script like this:\nuse std::path::Path;\n\nfn main() {\n    let r_include_dir =\n        std::env::var(\"R_INCLUDE_DIR\").expect(\"R_INCLUDE_DIR envvar must be provided.\");\n\n    cc::Build::new()\n        .file(\"src/unwind_protect_wrapper.c\")\n        .include(Path::new(&r_include_dir))\n        .compile(\"unwind_protect\");\n\n    println!(\"cargo:rerun-if-changed=src/unwind_protect_wrapper.c\");\n}\n\n\n\nExtern function definiton on Rust’s side\nTo let Rust call the function, we need an extern \"C\" function definiton on Rust’s side. Note that I’m not sure why the signature is this complex, but I just use the result of bindgen as it is.\nuse libR_sys::SEXP;\n\nextern \"C\" {\n    fn unwind_protect_impl(\n        fun: ::std::option::Option&lt;unsafe extern \"C\" fn(data: *mut ::std::os::raw::c_void) -&gt; SEXP&gt;,\n        data: *mut ::std::os::raw::c_void,\n    ) -&gt; SEXP;\n}\n\n\nRust function to call the C function\nTo actually call the above function from Rust code, we need an implementation like below to call unwind_protect(|| ...). This code is derived from extendr’s catch_r_error().\nuse libR_sys::SEXP;\n\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub enum Error {\n    UnexpectedType(String),\n    Aborted(SEXP),\n    Unknown,\n}\n\npub type Result&lt;T&gt; = std::result::Result&lt;T, Error&gt;;\n\npub unsafe fn unwind_protect&lt;F&gt;(f: F) -&gt; Result&lt;SEXP&gt;\nwhere\n    F: FnOnce() -&gt; SEXP + Copy,\n{\n    unsafe extern \"C\" fn do_call&lt;F&gt;(data: *mut std::os::raw::c_void) -&gt; SEXP\n    where\n        F: FnOnce() -&gt; SEXP + Copy,\n    {\n        let data = data as *const ();\n        let f: &F = &*(data as *const F);\n        f()\n    }\n\n    let fun_ptr = do_call::&lt;F&gt; as *const ();\n    let fun = std::mem::transmute(fun_ptr);\n    let data = std::mem::transmute(&f as *const F);\n    let res: SEXP = unwind_protect_impl(fun, data);\n\n    if (res as usize & 1) == 1 {\n        return Err(Error::Aborted(res));\n    }\n\n    Ok(res)\n}\n\n\nRust function to handle the result\nI use this function to handle various types of errors. But, in this post, we only need to handle Aborted error, so this might be a bit overkill. Anyway, the important point is that we must return the same type of result (in this case, SEXP) to C’s side. Even when the actual function doesn’t have any return values, we have to return some value like the one filled with R_NilValue.\nThis is because the final error handling (e.g., raising an error by Rf_error(), and resuming the aborted unwinding by R_ContinueUnwind()) is done on C’s side in this design. No return value means there’s no way to know whether calling the Rust function succeeded or not.\npub fn handle_result(result: Result&lt;SEXP&gt;) -&gt; SEXP {\n    match result {\n        Ok(res) =&gt; res,\n\n        Err(e) =&gt; match e {\n            // The token is already tagged, so pass it as it is.\n            Error::Aborted(token) =&gt; token,\n\n            // In other cases, return the error string with the tag\n            e =&gt; unsafe {\n                let msg = e.to_string();\n                let r_error = Rf_mkCharLenCE(\n                    msg.as_ptr() as *const i8,\n                    msg.len() as i32,\n                    cetype_t_CE_UTF8,\n                );\n\n                // set the error flag\n                (r_error as usize | 1) as SEXP\n            },\n        },\n    }\n}\n\n\nC function to handle the result\nLet’s look at the C’s side then. Again, as I described above, I use a tagged SEXP to indicate the error, but you can use any data structure. The point here is that a wrapper function like this must be implemented to handle unwinding. To handle errors from Rust code, you can raise an error in the R wrapper function instead of C. But, R_ContinueUnwind() cannot be called from R code, so this has to be done at C-level.\nstatic uintptr_t TAGGED_POINTER_MASK = (uintptr_t)1;\n\nSEXP handle_result(SEXP res_) {\n    uintptr_t res = (uintptr_t)res_;\n\n    // An error is indicated by tag.\n    if ((res & TAGGED_POINTER_MASK) == 1) {\n        // Remove tag\n        SEXP res_aligned = (SEXP)(res & ~TAGGED_POINTER_MASK);\n\n        // Currently, there are two types of error cases:\n        //\n        //   1. Error from Rust code\n        //   2. Error from R's C API, which is caught by R_UnwindProtect()\n        //\n        if (TYPEOF(res_aligned) == CHARSXP) {\n            // In case 1, the result is an error message that can be passed to\n            // Rf_error() directly.\n            Rf_error(\"%s\", CHAR(res_aligned));\n        } else {\n            // In case 2, the result is the token to restart the\n            // cleanup process on R's side.\n            R_ContinueUnwind(res_aligned);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return (SEXP)res;\n}\n\n\nExample implementation\nAn example implementation can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/yutannihilation/unextendr"

It would be:\n# An envvar cannot be referred to as $(NOT_CRAN)\nNOT_CRAN_ENVVAR = ${NOT_CRAN}\n\n$(STATLIB):\nifeq ($(NOT_CRAN_ENVVAR),\"true\")\n  cargo build --target=$(TARGET) --lib --release --manifest-path=./rust/Cargo.toml\nelse\n  CARGO_HOME=$(PWD)/.cargo cargo build --target=$(TARGET) --lib --release --manifest-path=./rust/Cargo.toml\n    rm -Rf $(CARGO_HOME)\n    rm -Rf $(LIBDIR)/build\nendif\n\n\nSet PATH\nOne more thing my Makevars (not Makevars.win this time) couldn’t covered was the case when cargo is on PATH but rustc is not. It seems gifski package handles this by including $(HOME)/.cargo/bin in PATH (Makevars).\nI think sourcing \"$(HOME)/.cargo/env\" should also work (this actually just sets PATH), so I’ll try this next time. Note that source is not available on dash, so use . for this.\n. \"$(HOME)/.cargo/env\" && cargo build ...\nOkay, done. Let’s move onto configure scripts."

Actually, I got this request from CRAN:\n\nBy the way, ideally string2path would use configure to test for cargo\n\nSo far, I used Makevars.win for testing the existence of cargo, but it seems configure scripts are the better place for this. Moreover, I do want to check the cargo functionality more precisely, for example,\n\nif the Rust version is not too old to support (“MSRV”)\n(Windows only) if the Rust installation has the required toolchain, stable-msvc\n(Windows only) if the Rust installation has the required targets, x86_64-pc-windows-gnu and i686-pc-windows-gnu\n\nbut Makevars.win is a bit too narrow to write a complex shell script."

But, let’s tweak it later.\n\n\nCheck if the Rust version is not too old to support\nThis isn’t always necessary, but we might want to reject the older Rust in the case when we use some feature that is available after the specific version of Rust. You know, comparing versions is tricky. But, this can be archived by sort command with -V option and -C option (c.f. SO answer). -V means version sort. -C means checking if the input is already sorted, and errors when it’s not. In summary, the implementation is the following:\n# c.f. https://github.com/ron-rs/ron/issues/256#issuecomment-657999081\nMIN_RUST_VERSION=\"1.41.0\"\n\nRUST_VERSION=\"`cargo --version | cut -d' ' -f2`\"\nif ! printf '%s\\n' \"${MIN_RUST_VERSION}\" \"${RUST_VERSION}\" | sort -C -V; then\n  echo \"The installed version of cargo (${RUST_VERSION}) is older than the requirement (${MIN_RUST_VERSION})\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n(Btw, did you know we cannot use $(expr) notation in configure because this syntax isn’t available on Solaris? We need to use `expr` instead)\n\n\nCheck if the Rust installation has the required toolchain and targets (Windows only)\nOn Windows, extendr provides support only the specified set of toolchain and target. So, we need to check it.\nChecking toolchain is simple. Use + to specify the toolchain.\nEXPECTED_TOOLCHAIN=\"stable-msvc\"\n\ncargo \"+${EXPECTED_TOOLCHAIN}\" version &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&1\nif [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\n  echo \"${EXPECTED_TOOLCHAIN} toolchain is not installed\"\n  exit 1\nfi\nInstalled targets can be listed by rustup target list --installed. So, the check would be like\nEXPECTED_TARGET=\"x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\"\n\nif ! rustup target list --installed | grep -q \"${EXPECTED_TARGET}\"; then\n  echo \"target ${EXPECTED_TARGET} is not installed\"\n  exit 1\nfi\nOne thing tricky here is that, unlike Makevars.win, configure.win is executed only once, not per architecture. So, we need to manually enumerate both 64-bit and 32-bit.\nOne more tricky thing at the time of writing this is…, you might not notice, the 32-bit version no longer exists in R-devel, which is supposed to be released as R 4.2! So, we want to check 32-bit only when there’s 32-bit. How? I couldn’t come up with some nice way, but it seems check on ${R_HOME}/bin/i386/ works:\ncheck_cargo_target() {\n  EXPECTED_TARGET=\"$1\"\n  \n  if ! rustup target list --installed | grep -q \"${EXPECTED_TARGET}\"; then\n    echo \"target ${EXPECTED_TARGET} is not installed\"\n    exit 1\n  fi\n}\n\ncheck_cargo_target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\n\nif [ -d \"${R_HOME}/bin/i386/\" ]; then\n  check_cargo_target i686-pc-windows-gnu\nfi"

There are several things to consider. For example:\n\nAs this downloads the binary before $(STATLIB) is executed, we need some tweak to ensure it’s not removed by C_clean\n(Windows only) unlike Makevars.win is executed per arch, configure.win is executed only once\n\nWhat’s more, I want to make one addition:\n\nVerify the checksums\n\nSome might have wondered if it’s safe to download an arbitrary binary from GitHub. First of all, I’d argue it’s safe. To say the least, essentially, it’s no unsafer than downloading a cargo binary itself, (or than “curl URL | sh”). If it’s downloaded over HTTPS, the data hardly gets compromised as long as their servers are not compromised. I believe GitHub servers and Rust servers are both very secure.\nThat said, we can improve the security further by “pinning” the binary. So, I recommend verifying the checksum when downloading a binary. For example, the stringi package does this.\n\nMakevars.in and Makevars.win.in\nRemember Makevars.win has these lines ($(STATLIB) is the artifact of the Rust code):\nall: C_clean\nC_clean:\n    rm -Rf $(SHLIB) $(STATLIB) $(OBJECTS)\nRemoving $(STATLIB) is needed to invoke cargo build in the case when cargo is installed. Otherwise, $(STATLIB) keeps existing, which means that target is never executed.\nOn the other hand, we don’t want to execute cargo build if there’s no cargo. So, in this case, we need to prevent the downloaded binary from getting removed.\nIn order to change the logic like this, we can use Makevars.in and Makevars.win.in as a template to generate Makevars and Makevars.win respectively. Generating these files can be done in configure and configure.win. For example,\nMakevars.in:\nC_clean:\n    rm -Rf $(SHLIB) $(OBJECTS) @CLEAN_EXTRA@\nconfigure:\n# cargo installed\nsed -e 's|@CLEAN_EXTRA@|$(STATLIB)|' src/Makevars.in &gt; src/Makevars\n\n# no cargo\nsed -e 's|@CLEAN_EXTRA@||' src/Makevars.in &gt; src/Makevars\nIf we generate Makevars and Makevars.win in configure scripts, we also need to clean up these by the cleanup script (this is required by Writing R Extensions).\nrm -f src/Makevars src/Makevars.win\nOf course, don’t forget to add src/Makevars and src/Makevars.win to .gitignore.\n(Probably, we can generate more sophisticated Makevars, but this time I used only this one replacement.)\n\n\nVerify the checksums\nTo verify the checksum, we can use sha256sum on platforms other than macOS, and shasum -a 256 on macOS. For the example of macOS:\nSHA256SUM_EXPECTED=be65f074cb7ae50e5784e7650f48579fff35f30ff663d1c01eabdc9f35c1f87c\n\n# Verify the checksum\nSHA256SUM_ACTUAL=`shasum -a 256 \"${DST}\" | cut -d' ' -f1`\nif [ -z \"${SHA256SUM_ACTUAL}\" ]; then\n  echo \"Failed to get the checksum\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nif [ \"${SHA256SUM_ACTUAL}\" != \"${SHA256SUM_EXPECTED}\" ]; then\n  echo \"Checksum mismatch for the pre-compiled binary\"\n  exit 1\nfi"

So, in short, extendr is the game changer.\n\n\n&[T]\nIf you are already familiar with Rust, you might feel using Vec&lt;T&gt; as arguments looks a bit weird. In fact, the document of Vec&lt;T&gt; says:\n\nIn Rust, it’s more common to pass slices as arguments rather than vectors when you just want to provide read access. The same goes for String and &str.\n(https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#slicing)\n\nYes, you can use &[T] instead of Vec&lt;T&gt;, and this seems to matter on the performance slightly. If you are familiar with Rust to the extent that you know the difference between &[T] and Vec&lt;T&gt; (confession: I’m not!), you can should use &[T] instead. Otherwise, Vec&lt;T&gt; just works.\n\n#[extendr]\nfn add2_slice(x: &[i32], y: &[i32]) -&gt; Vec&lt;i32&gt; {\n    x.iter().enumerate().map(|(i, x)| x + y[i]).collect()\n}\n\n\nadd2_slice(1:2, 2:3)\n\n[1] 3 5\n\n\nPlease note that this isn’t the reference to the original R object, just that to the copied values.

    "title": "Plot geom_sf() On OpenStreetMap Tiles",

    "text": "Get Tile URLs\nAccording to Slippy map tilenames, the URL of a tile follows this format:\nhttps://[abc].tile.openstreetmap.org/zoom/x/y.png \nI have to fill these four parts:\n\n[abc]\nzoom\nx\ny\n\nLet’s look at these one by one.\n\n[abc]\n[abc] means there are three domains; a.tile.openstreetmap.org, b.tile.openstreetmap.org, c.tile.openstreetmap.org. But, why? It says:\n\nBrowser-based applications can thus request multiple tiles from multiple subdomains faster than from one subdomain.\n\nSo, as I’m not browser-based, I can choose arbitrary one.\n\n\nzoom\nZoom parameter is an integer number from 0 to 19. If zoom is 0, there’s only one tile. Likewise 2 x 2 tiles for zoom 1, 4 x 4 tiles for zoom 2, and so on. Then, which one should I choose? This can be roughly determined based on the size of the bbox (boundary box) of the sf object.\n\n# get the bbox\nb &lt;- sf::st_bbox(nc)\nb\n\n     xmin      ymin      xmax      ymax \n-84.32385  33.88199 -75.45698  36.58965 \n\n# calculate the lengths of x and y of the bbox\nx_len &lt;- b[\"xmax\"] - b[\"xmin\"]\ny_len &lt;- b[\"ymax\"] - b[\"ymin\"]\n\n# calculate the minimum zoom level that is smaller than the lengths\nx_zoom &lt;- sum(x_len &lt; 360 / 2^(0:19)) - 1\ny_zoom &lt;- sum(y_len &lt; 170.1022 / 2^(0:19)) - 1\n\nzoom &lt;- min(x_zoom, y_zoom)\nzoom\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nBut, since the tile is so small as 256 × 256 pixel, it’s often better to zoom more.\n\nzoom &lt;- zoom + 2\n\n(I’m not sure how to do this correctly, I guess the zoom level should be determined by the size of the plot canvas, not the bbox.)\n\n\nx and y\nA pair of x and y represents the location of a tile. x corresponds to longitude, y to latitude. If the zoom is given, I can convert longitudes and latitudes to x and y according to the pseudo code on OpenStreetMap’s wiki:\n\nsec &lt;- function(x) {\n  1 / cos(x)\n}\n\nlonlat2xy &lt;- function(lat_deg, lon_deg, zoom) {\n  n &lt;- 2^zoom\n\n  x &lt;- (n * (lat_deg + 180)) %/% 360\n  lon_rad &lt;- lon_deg * pi / 180\n  y &lt;- (n * (1 - log(tan(lon_rad) + sec(lon_rad)) / pi)) %/% 2\n\n  list(x = x, y = y)\n}\n\nBut, how can I find the set of tiles which covers the whole bbox?\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\np &lt;- ggplot(nc) +\n  geom_sf() +\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = b[\"xmin\"], xmax = b[\"xmax\"], ymin = b[\"ymin\"], ymax = b[\"ymax\"],\n           colour = alpha(\"red\", 0.4), fill = \"transparent\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1.2)\n\nsize aesthetic has been deprecated for use with lines as of ggplot2 3.4.0\nℹ Please use linewidth aesthetic instead\nThis message is displayed once every 8 hours.\n\np\n\n\n\n\nThis problem can be simplified; I can focus only two corners, the north-west and the south-east. If I calculate which tiles of x and y those two points fall in, I can find the rest of the tiles by filling the sequences of x and y between these two tiles.\n\ncorners &lt;- expand.grid(x = b[c(1, 3)], y = b[c(2, 4)])\n\np +\n  geom_point(aes(x, y), corners[2:3,], colour = \"red\", size = 5)\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the tiles:\n\nxy &lt;- lonlat2xy(b[c(\"xmin\", \"xmax\")], b[c(\"ymin\", \"ymax\")], zoom)\n\ntiles &lt;- expand.grid(x = seq(xy$x[\"xmin\"], xy$x[\"xmax\"]),\n                     y = seq(xy$y[\"ymin\"], xy$y[\"ymax\"]))\n\ntiles\n\n   x  y\n1 34 51\n2 35 51\n3 36 51\n4 37 51\n5 34 50\n6 35 50\n7 36 50\n8 37 50\n\n\n\n\nTile URLs\nFrom the results above, I can yield the URLs of the tiles:\n\nurls &lt;- sprintf(\"https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/%d/%d/%d.png\", zoom, tiles$x, tiles$y)\nurls\n\n[1] \"https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/7/34/51.png\"\n[2] \"https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/7/35/51.png\"\n[3] \"https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/7/36/51.png\"\n[4] \"https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/7/37/51.png\"\n[5] \"https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/7/34/50.png\"\n[6] \"https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/7/35/50.png\"\n[7] \"https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/7/36/50.png\"\n[8] \"https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/7/37/50.png\"\n\n\nOK, now I can download them. But, before that, let’s confirm that the tiles really cover the expected area.\n\n\nTile positions\nTo plot these tiles, I calculate the north-west corner of a tile by the following code (the pseudo code for this is also found on the wiki):\n\nxy2lonlat &lt;- function(x, y, zoom) {\n  n &lt;- 2^zoom\n\n  lon_deg &lt;- x / n * 360.0 - 180.0\n  lat_rad &lt;- atan(sinh(pi * (1 - 2 * y / n)))\n  lat_deg &lt;- lat_rad * 180.0 / pi\n\n  list(lon_deg = lon_deg, lat_deg = lat_deg)\n}\n\nThen, south-east corners can be also calculated easily. Let’s calculate the both corners and bind them to a data.frame.\n\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\n\nnw_corners &lt;- pmap_dfr(tiles, xy2lonlat, zoom = zoom)\n# add 1 to x and y to get the south-east corners\nse_corners &lt;- pmap_dfr(mutate_all(tiles, `+`, 1), xy2lonlat, zoom = zoom)\n\nnames(nw_corners) &lt;- c(\"xmin\", \"ymax\")\nnames(se_corners) &lt;- c(\"xmax\", \"ymin\")\n\ntile_positions &lt;- bind_cols(nw_corners, se_corners)\ntile_positions\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n   xmin  ymax  xmax  ymin\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 -84.4  34.3 -81.6  32.0\n2 -81.6  34.3 -78.8  32.0\n3 -78.8  34.3 -75.9  32.0\n4 -75.9  34.3 -73.1  32.0\n5 -84.4  36.6 -81.6  34.3\n6 -81.6  36.6 -78.8  34.3\n7 -78.8  36.6 -75.9  34.3\n8 -75.9  36.6 -73.1  34.3\n\n\nNow I can plot the empty tiles as below:\n\np +\n  geom_point(aes(x, y), corners[2:3,], colour = \"red\", size = 5) +\n  geom_rect(data = tile_positions,\n            aes(xmin = xmin, xmax = xmax, ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax),\n            colour = \"blue\", fill = \"transparent\")\n\n\n\n\nYay, confirmed! Let’s proceed to the next step."

More precisely, it calculates group IDs based on the combination of discrete variables here. So, usually, specifying a discrete variable on colour or fill is enough.\n\nggplot(d, aes(x, y, colour = type)) +\n  geom_line(size = 3)\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, lines need groups. Accordingly, we need to consider the group when we sieve the data. Otherwise, the lines will be incomplete as this example:\n\n# data whose values are &gt;=10\nd_sieved2 &lt;- filter(d, value &gt;= 10)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data = d, aes(x, y, group = type), size = 3, colour = \"grey\") +\n  geom_line(data = d_sieved2, aes(x, y, colour = type), size = 3)\n\n\n\n\nSo, the correct way of doing this is to use group_by() and some aggregate functions like max() so that the calculations are done by group.\n\n# data series whose max values are &gt;=10\nd_sieved3 &lt;- d %&gt;%\n  group_by(type) %&gt;% \n  filter(max(value) &gt;= 10)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data = d, aes(x, y, group = type), size = 3, colour = \"grey\") +\n  geom_line(data = d_sieved3, aes(x, y, colour = type), size = 3)"

    "section": "Provide precompiled binaries for Windows",
    "text": "Provide precompiled binaries for Windows\nAs you might have already noticed, the setup instruction for Windows is a bit complex compared to other OSes (i.e., Linux and macOS). So, it might be worth considering providing the precompiled static libraries, just like rwinlib does for many C++ libraries.\nOther motivation is that some of CRAN machines don’t have Rust toolchain. If the package author wants to submit their package to CRAN, such a mechanism is needed.\n(edit: it seems macOS is also the case, but I don’t find what’s the best way to solve this. I’ll probably write another post for this.)\nThere probably isn’t a single standard way to achieve this, but let me share what I did for my package, string2path here. YMMV, of course.\nI used softprops/action-gh-release action to publish the binaries as a GitHub release. The setting would be like this:\n# rename the binaries before uploading so that we can distinguish them easily.\n- name: Tweak staticlib\n  if: runner.os == 'Windows'\n  run: |\n    mv ./check/string2path.Rcheck/00_pkg_src/string2path/src-i386/rust/target/i686-pc-windows-gnu/release/libstring2path.a \\\n      i686-pc-windows-gnu-libstring2path.a\n    mv ./check/string2path.Rcheck/00_pkg_src/string2path/src-x64/rust/target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/libstring2path.a \\\n      x86_64-pc-windows-gnu-libstring2path.a\n\n- name: Release\n  uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1\n  # only run this on a tag event\n  if: runner.os == 'Windows' && startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')\n  with:\n    fail_on_unmatched_files: true\n    files: |\n      i686-pc-windows-gnu-libstring2path.a\n      x86_64-pc-windows-gnu-libstring2path.a\nWith this setup, you can publish the binaries by pushing tags. For example, let’s create windows_20210801-3 tag and push it.\ngit tag windows_20210801-3\ngit push origin windows_20210801-3\nThen, the GHA will publish the corresponding release like this:\n\nNext, tweak src/Makefile.win as follows to allow users to download the binaries when cargo is not available. There might be more nicer code to choose the latest release automatically, but I think it’s safe to specify a fixed tag name, though it’s a bit tiresome to update this manually every time you update Rust code.\n(edit: I found this violates the CRAN policy. A package is not allowed to write “anywhere else on the file system apart from the R session’s temporary directory. You need to set CARGO_HOME envvar to some temporary directory to avoid this.)\nCRATE = foo   # your crate name\nBASE_TAG = windows_20210801-3  # the tag you want to use\n\n# c.f. https://stackoverflow.com/a/34756868\n# Note that this assignment (`:=`) is not available on Solaris, so you need to\n# add \"GNU make\" to SystemRequirements field on DESCRIPTION, even though this\n# can never compile on Solaris anyway...\nCARGO_EXISTS := $(shell cargo --version 2&gt; /dev/null)\n\n# ..snip...\n\n$(STATLIB):\nifdef CARGO_EXISTS\n    cargo build --target=$(TARGET) --lib --release --manifest-path=./rust/Cargo.toml\nelse\n    mkdir -p $(LIBDIR)\n    curl -L -o $(STATLIB) https://github.com/yutannihilation/$(CRATE)/releases/download/$(BASE_TAG)/$(TARGET)-lib$(CRATE).a\nendif\nOne caveat is that this won’t work when cargo is installed but with the GNU toolchain (extendr requires the MSVC toolchain on Windows). I guess some friendlier check can be done in configure.win, but this post won’t look into the details."

    "text": "What does gt teach us?\nA while ago, gt package, Richard Iannone’s work-in-progress great work, was made public.\ngt package is wonderful, especially in that it makes us rethink about the possible semantics of columns. I mean, not all columns are equal. No, I don’t say anything new; this is what you already know with spread() and gather().\n\nspread()ed data explained\nTake a look at this example data, a simpler version of the one in ?gather:\n\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nset.seed(1)\n# example in ?gather\nstocks &lt;- tibble(\n  time = as.Date('2009-01-01') + 0:2,\n  X = rnorm(3, 0, 1),\n  Y = rnorm(3, 0, 2),\n  Z = rnorm(3, 0, 4)\n)\n\nstocks\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  time            X      Y     Z\n  &lt;date&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2009-01-01 -0.626  3.19   1.95\n2 2009-01-02  0.184  0.659  2.95\n3 2009-01-03 -0.836 -1.64   2.30\n\n\nHere, X, Y, and Z are the prices of stock X, Y, and Z. Of course, we can gather() the columns as this is the very example for this, but, we also can bundle these columns using tab_spanner():\n\ngt(stocks) %&gt;%\n  tab_spanner(\"price\", c(X, Y, Z))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntime\nprice\n\n\nX\nY\nZ\n\n\n\n\n2009-01-01\n-0.6264538\n3.1905616\n1.949716\n\n\n2009-01-02\n0.1836433\n0.6590155\n2.953299\n\n\n2009-01-03\n-0.8356286\n-1.6409368\n2.303125\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYet another option is to specify groupname_col. We roughly think each row is a group and time is the grouping variable here:\n\ngt(stocks, groupname_col = \"time\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\nY\nZ\n\n\n\n\n2009-01-01\n\n\n-0.6264538\n3.1905616\n1.949716\n\n\n2009-01-02\n\n\n0.1836433\n0.6590155\n2.953299\n\n\n2009-01-03\n\n\n-0.8356286\n-1.6409368\n2.303125\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngather()ed data explained\nLet’s see the gathered version next. Here’s the data:\n\nstocksm &lt;- stocks %&gt;%\n  tidyr::gather(\"name\", \"value\", X:Z)\n\nstocksm\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 3\n  time       name   value\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2009-01-01 X     -0.626\n2 2009-01-02 X      0.184\n3 2009-01-03 X     -0.836\n4 2009-01-01 Y      3.19 \n5 2009-01-02 Y      0.659\n6 2009-01-03 Y     -1.64 \n7 2009-01-01 Z      1.95 \n8 2009-01-02 Z      2.95 \n9 2009-01-03 Z      2.30 \n\n\nThis can be represented in a similar way. This time, a group doesn’t consist of a single row, but the rows with the same grouping values. Accordingly, the grouping is the same as above.\n\nstocksm %&gt;%\n  gt(groupname_col = \"time\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\nvalue\n\n\n\n\n2009-01-01\n\n\nX\n-0.6264538\n\n\nY\n3.1905616\n\n\nZ\n1.9497162\n\n\n2009-01-02\n\n\nX\n0.1836433\n\n\nY\n0.6590155\n\n\nZ\n2.9532988\n\n\n2009-01-03\n\n\nX\n-0.8356286\n\n\nY\n-1.6409368\n\n\nZ\n2.3031254\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see the only difference is the rotation. So, theoretically, this can be implemented as grouping + rotating."

    "text": "Reason 1: Avoid unnecessary protection\nI explained the basic concept of R’s protection mechanism in R, Rust, Protect, And Unwinding. So, if you are not familiar with these, it might be better to read it first.\nYeah, protection is important. But, we don’t need to protect what’s already protected. Actually, WRE says:\n\nFor functions from packages as well as R to safely co-operate in protecting objects, certain rules have to be followed:\n\nCaller protection. It is the responsibility of the caller that all arguments passed to a function are protected and will stay protected for the whole execution of the callee. (…snip…)\nProtecting return values. Any R objects returned from a function are unprotected (the callee must maintain pointer-protection balance), and hence should be protected immediately by the caller. (…snip…)\n\n(…snip…)\n\nSo, this means,\n\nR objects passed from the caller should be already protected because it’s the caller’s responsibility. Actually, if the input comes from the R session, the R objects are what belongs to some environment (e.g., global environment), which manes it never gets GCed accidentally.\nOn the other hand, R objects returned from R API functions like Rf_allocVector() are unprotected. It’s us who have to protect.\n\nIf we protect, we have to unprotect later. Since the object might outlive the Rust function call, unprotection is typically done in Drop trait like this. If we want to enable this destructor only on the R objects that we protected, i.e. the “owned” version, we need a separate type for each.\nimpl Drop for OwnedStringSxp {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        protect::release_from_preserved_list(self.token);\n    }\n}"

    "text": "Reason 2: Avoid unnecessary ALTREP checks\nFor INTSXP and REALSXP, we might be able to skip calling INTEGER_ELT() and REAL_ELT() by accessing the underlying C array of int (i32) or double (f64) directly. But, it’s not always the case that the SEXP has the underlying C array; it can be ALTREP. So, we typically need if branches for ALTREP case and other cases. For example, cpp11’s code:\n  return is_altrep_ ? INTEGER_ELT(data_, pos) : data_p_[pos];\n  if (is_altrep_) {\n    SET_INTEGER_ELT(data_, length_, value);\n  } else {\n    data_p_[length_] = value;\n  }\nBut, if the object is created by calling Rf_allocVector() by ourselves, it’s probably reasonable to assume it’s not ALTREP (I’m not sure if it’s guaranteed that Rf_allocVector() does and will always return non-ALTREP SEXP, though. Use this at your own risk!). Under the assumption, I can write a bit simpler code like this:\nimpl OwnedRealSxp {\n    pub fn new(len: usize) -&gt; Self {\n        let inner = unsafe { Rf_allocVector(REALSXP, len as _) };\n        let token = protect::insert_to_preserved_list(inner);\n        \n        // store the raw pointer\n        let raw = unsafe { REAL(inner) };\n\n\n        Self {\n            inner,\n            token,\n            len,\n            raw,\n        }\n    }\n    \n    pub fn elt(&mut self, i: usize) -&gt; f64 {\n        unsafe { *(self.raw.add(index)) }\n    }\n\n    pub fn set_elt(&mut self, i: usize, v: f64) {\n        unsafe { (self.raw.add(index)) = v }\n    }\n}\nThat said, if such a variable like is_altrep_ is stored on creation, it’s probably not very costly to check it every time. Also, this only matters on INTSXP and REALSXP (the internal representation of LGLSXP is int, not bool. STRSXP is a vector of CHARSXP). So, my direction might not be very clever. I’m yet to figure out."

    "title": "R, Rust, Protect, And Unwinding",
    "section": "Protect",
    "text": "Protect\nFirst, let’s talk about how to protect R objects. Protect from what? From the garbage collection (GC) mechanism of R. Writing R Extension (WRE) says:\n\nThe memory allocated for R objects is not freed by the user; instead, the memory is from time to time garbage collected. That is, some or all of the allocated memory not being used is freed or marked as re-usable.\n\nSo, we have to claim the objects we use are in use, otherwise they might be accidentally freed while we are using it, which will causes serious problems. As far as I know, there are mainly 3 ways to do this “protection”.\n\nPROTECT() (or Rf_protect())\nThe most basic one is the PROTECT() macro. WRE says:\n\nIf you create an R object in your C code, you must tell R that you are using the object by using the PROTECT macro on a pointer to the object. This tells R that the object is in use so it is not destroyed during garbage collection\n\nPROTECT() takes an SEXP and returns the SEXP, so you can use this like the following example on WRE:\nSEXP ab;\nab = PROTECT(allocVector(REALSXP, 2));\nREAL(ab)[0] = 123.45;\nREAL(ab)[1] = 67.89;\nYou can also use PROTECT() in a separate line.\nSEXP ab;\nab = allocVector(REALSXP, 2);\nPROTECT(ab);\nREAL(ab)[0] = 123.45;\nREAL(ab)[1] = 67.89;\nWow, super simple. Now that it gets protected, we’ve all done, right? Well, no. You have to remove that PROTECT()ion when it gets no longer needed, otherwise your memory will be exhausted.\nThis can be done by UNPROTECT(). So, the full function definition would be like this:\nSEXP new_real2() {\n    SEXP ab;\n    ab = PROTECT(allocVector(REALSXP, 2));\n\n    REAL(ab)[0] = 123.45;\n    REAL(ab)[1] = 67.89;\n\n    UNPROTECT(1);\n    return ab;\n}\nHere, you might wonder why UNPROTECT() takes an integer while the corresponding function PROTECT() takes an SEXP. This is because the protection mechanism is stack-based. WRE says:\n\nThe protection mechanism is stack-based, so UNPROTECT(n) unprotects the last n objects which were protected.\n\nUNPROTECT() can unprotect only from the top of the stack. This means you cannot do something like “let’s return an object with protection and unprotect later in another function.” If something gets PROTECT()ed in a function, it’s required to be UNPROTECT() within the function. WRE says:\n\nCalls to PROTECT and UNPROTECT should balance in each function. A function may only call UNPROTECT or REPROTECT on objects it has itself protected.\n\nI don’t know well about the design of data structures, but I guess the advantages of being stack-based are\n\nfast\ncan be unwound (WRE says: “Note that the pointer protection stack balance is restored automatically on non-local transfer of control (..snip..) as if a call to UNPROTECT was invoked with the right argument.”)\n\n\n\nR_PreserveObject()\nWhile the rule of PROTECT() requires as above, we certainly have many valid cases that are not covered by this:\n\nWe want the object to live among multiple function calls\nWe want the object to live forever (i.e., until the R session ends)\n\nAn example of case 1 is to wrap SEXP objects in a C++ class, which should protect in its constructor and unprotect in its destructor (how to call the destructor properly is another headache, but let’s discuss later).\nFortunately, R provides R_PreserveObject() and the corresponding function R_ReleaseObject() for this. WRE says:\n\na call to R_PreserveObject adds an object to an internal list of objects not to be collects, and a subsequent call to R_ReleaseObject removes it from that list. This provides a way for objects which are not returned as part of R objects to be protected across calls to compiled code\n\nSo, it sounds like R_PreserveObject() supersedes PROTECT(). Why not use it all the time?? Well, while R_PreserveObject() is great, it’s slow. WRE says:\n\nIt is less efficient than the normal protection mechanism, and should be used sparingly.\n\nWhy slow? This is because how it’s implemented. The explanation in the related performance issue says:\n\nThis is a simple linked list, so has to be searched linearly to remove objects pushed on early.\n\nSo, are there any efficient ways to provide protection longer than one function call? The answer is simple. To prevent an SEXP from being considered as unused, we can actually use it!\n\n\nGet referenced by another SEXP\nWRE says:\n\nProtecting an R object automatically protects all the R objects pointed to in the corresponding SEXPREC, for example all elements of a protected list are automatically protected.\n\nTo put this into simpler words, if an R object already belongs to another R object (e.g., an element of a list), it doesn’t need the protection of PROTECT() or R_PreserveObject(). Actually, that’s why functions are supposed to return unprotected results; on the R session, the returned value is immediately assinged to a variable in some environment.\nWe can utilize this spec in several ways. A straightforward implementation of this is to have one big R_PreserveObject()ed list as the “anchor” and assign R objects to it. extendr uses this way (code). But, if this is done naively, it would also be inefficient as R_ReleaseObject() to search linearly which one to unprotect. So, extendr uses a hashmap nicely. Another reason of hashmap is that extendr allows Clone, so it must track the reference count on Rust’s side as well, but let’s not talk about the details here.\nMore sophisticated example is cpp11. It uses a doubly-linked-list approach (code), which is based on the suggestion in the issue above. This is more efficient when unprotecting. The C++ code is a bit advanced, so my naive implementation in Rust might be a bit easier to read.\n\n\nWhen to use which?\nIn summary, we have mainly 3 options to protect:\n\nPROTECT()\nR_PreserveObject()\nGet refrenced by another SEXP\n\nYou might wonder if we should always use case 3. But, if you look at the implementation of cpp11, it will easily remind you that PROTECT() is needed anyway until the object gets referenced. If you care about efficiency, you should use PROTECT() when it’s enough.\nIn my understanding, ideally we should\n\nUse PROTECT() everywhere as long as the protection is needed within the function\nUse R_PreserveObject() for objects that are never released during the R session\nUse the doubly-linked list when an object needs protection longer than one function call but shorter than one R session\n\nThis topic still has more room to discuss, but let’s move on as this is not the main one of this post!"

    "section": "Unwinding and longjmp",
    "text": "Unwinding and longjmp\nWhat is unwinding? Honestly, I’m not confident what exactly this term refers to, but it seems it’s a cleanup process when some exception happens. For example, Wikipedia says:\n\nReturning from the called function will pop the top frame off the stack, perhaps leaving a return value. The more general act of popping one or more frames off the stack to resume execution elsewhere in the program is called stack unwinding and must be performed when non-local control structures are used, such as those used for exception handling.\n\nUsually, this explanation should be satisfying. But, as I’m talking about Rust, things are a bit more complicated. “non-local control structures” means panic!() to Rust, which we don’t try to catch in usual cases. Yes…, this is the core of the problem I’m writing. Let’s revisit later.\n\nDifferent languages have different unwinding mechanism\nLet’s forget about Rust. Suppose we want to use C++.\nC++ and Rust are the same in that it has difficulty to handle longjmp. C++’s class has destructor, which is called when the object is deleted. So, in theory, a C++ class of a wrapper of an R object can manage the protection with including the unprotecting operation in its destructor.\nHowever, the problem is that, the destructor can be called only in C++’s exception handling. If some R error, which is implemented using longjmp, happens on calling R’s C APIs, the destructor is not called. More details can be found the following blog post by the R core member:\nUse of C++ in Packages - The R Blog\n\nUnfortunately, RAII does not work with setjmp/longjmp functions provided by the C runtime for exception handling.\n\n\n\nR_UnwindProtect()\nFortunately, R’s C API provides a function for this, R_UnwindProtect(). This is something like tryCatch() at the C-level. The signature is:\nSEXP R_UnwindProtect(SEXP (*fun)(void *data), void *data,\n                     void (*clean)(void *data, Rboolean jump), void *cdata,\n                     SEXP cont);\nBasically, this is to wrap fun(data). If a longjmp error happens during the execution of fun(data), clean(cdata, TRUE) will be called before actually doing longjmp.\nIn the C++’s case, it is intended to throw C++ exception in clean() to let C++’s stack unwinding happen first. Then, R_ContinueUnwind(cont) can be used for moving back to C’s (or R’s) exception handling. cont is an R object created by R_MakeUnwindCont().\nFor a real example, cpp11’s implemntation is (code):\n  static SEXP token = [] {\n    SEXP res = R_MakeUnwindCont();\n    R_PreserveObject(res);\n    return res;\n  }();\n\n  std::jmp_buf jmpbuf;\n  if (setjmp(jmpbuf)) {\n    should_unwind_protect = TRUE;\n    throw unwind_exception(token);\n  }\n\n  SEXP res = R_UnwindProtect(\n      [](void* data) -&gt; SEXP {\n        auto callback = static_cast&lt;decltype(&code)&gt;(data);\n        return static_cast&lt;Fun&&&gt;(*callback)();\n      },\n      &code,\n      [](void* jmpbuf, Rboolean jump) {\n        if (jump == TRUE) {\n          // We need to first jump back into the C++ stacks because you can't safely\n          // throw exceptions from C stack frames.\n          longjmp(*static_cast&lt;std::jmp_buf*&gt;(jmpbuf), 1);\n        }\n      },\n      &jmpbuf, token);\nNote that this is a bit more complex than what WRE describes. As the comment says, this first jumps into the C++ stack by longjmp(), and throws the C++ exception there (the if branch with setjmp()). The error is caught by a try-catch block like this (a simplefied version of this original code):\nSEXP err = R_NilValue\ntry {\n\n  // ...snip...\n\n}\ncatch (cpp11::unwind_exception & e) {\n  err = e.token\n  R_ContinueUnwind(err);\n}\n\n\nSo, what about Rust?\nOkay, let’s come back to Rust. Rust also has destructor (i.e., Drop trait), so we’ll face the same problem. Can we survive with the same approach as C++?\nYes and no. Rust has a kind of try-catch, std::panic::catch_unwind() while its document says:\n\nIt is not recommended to use this function for a general try/catch mechanism.\n\nSo…, it’s kind of possible. Actually, extendr uses catch_unwind() (code). In the code below, the cleanup function do_cleanup() calls panic!(), which is caught by catch_unwind().\npub fn catch_r_error&lt;F&gt;(f: F) -&gt; Result&lt;SEXP&gt;\nwhere\n    F: FnOnce() -&gt; SEXP + Copy,\n    F: std::panic::UnwindSafe,\n{\n    // ...snip...\n\n    unsafe extern \"C\" fn do_cleanup(_: *mut raw::c_void, jump: Rboolean) {\n        if jump != 0 {\n            panic!(\"R has thrown an error.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    unsafe {\n        let fun_ptr = do_call::&lt;F&gt; as *const ();\n        let clean_ptr = do_cleanup as *const ();\n        let x = false;\n        let fun = std::mem::transmute(fun_ptr);\n        let cleanfun = std::mem::transmute(clean_ptr);\n        let data = std::mem::transmute(&f);\n        let cleandata = std::mem::transmute(&x);\n        let cont = R_MakeUnwindCont();\n        Rf_protect(cont);\n\n        // Note that catch_unwind does not work for 32 bit windows targets.\n        let res = match std::panic::catch_unwind(|| {\n            R_UnwindProtect(fun, data, cleanfun, cleandata, cont)\n        }) {\n            Ok(res) =&gt; Ok(res),\n            Err(_) =&gt; Err(\"Error in protected R code\".into()),\n        };\n        Rf_unprotect(1);\n        res\n    }\n}\nIn general, panic!() should be avoided when the Rust function is called over FFI. panic!() causes unwinding, and cross-language unwinding is considered as undefined behavior (cf., Rust “ffi-unwind” project - FAQ).\nHowever, the problem is, we have to jump. We must escape from the cleanup function. Otherwise, R_ContinueUnwind(cont) will be called (code) automatically.\n    cleanfun(cleandata, jump);\n\n    if (jump)\n        R_ContinueUnwind(cont); \nRust doesn’t have longjmp / setjmp (rust-lang/rfcs#2625), so the last resort is panic!(). While we know it’s not good, there’s no option left as far as I know.\n(Update: I found I was wrong. We can get rid of panic!())\nI’m honestly not sure the current extendr’s implementation is really safe, but it seems we anyway need a similar implementation to get things work. (However, I think it’s probably a mistake that it doesn’t call R_ContinueUnwind(cont) to resume the unwinding process on C’s side.)"

Usually, we can just include Cargo.lock, and then Cargo always downloads the fixed versions and verifies the checksums. But, that’s the rule. We should prevent Cargo from downloading any sources.\nThe solution is simple. We can use cargo vendor to include the sources of the dependencies. At first, I thought it was not realistic because my dependency was over 100MB. But, David B. Dahl, an author of another R package using Rust, kindly suggested we can compress them to a tarball.\nConverting them into a tarball is necessary also because otherwise we would get this warning:\nstoring paths of more than 100 bytes is not portable.\nMore details can be found in the following files:\n\nsrc/Makevars.in\nsrc/cargo_vendor_config.toml : this will be moved to .cargo/config.toml to use the vendored sources on compiling.\nsrc/rust/vendor.sh : this updates the tarball\n\n\n\n2. doesn’t describe the authorship and copyright\nThis was simply my oversight. The CRAN Policy says:\n\nThe ownership of copyright and intellectual property rights of all components of the package must be clear and unambiguous (including from the authors specification in the DESCRIPTION file). Where code is copied (or derived) from the work of others (including from R itself), care must be taken that any copyright/license statements are preserved and authorship is not misrepresented.\n…snip…\n(‘All components’ includes any downloaded at installation or during use.)\n\nFirst, let’s think about the authorship. It also explains how to describe the information:\n\nPreferably, an ‘Authors@R’ field would be used with ‘ctb’ roles for the authors of such code. Alternatively, the ‘Author’ field should list these authors as contributors.\nWhere copyrights are held by an entity other than the package authors, this should preferably be indicated via ‘cph’ roles in the ‘Authors@R’ field, or using a ‘Copyright’ field (if necessary referring to an inst/COPYRIGHTS file).\n\nThis is a bit complex; this requires to treat humans and non-human entities differently, but it’s a bit tough job to judge human and non-human one by one… Fortunately, it seems it’s a common practice to use either inst/AUTHORS or inst/COPYRIGHTS and write “see inst/… for details” in DESCRIPTION even when there’s both humans and non-humans. These files are explained in Writing R Extensions:\n\nAnother file sometimes needed in inst is AUTHORS or COPYRIGHTS to specify the authors or copyright holders when this is too complex to put in the DESCRIPTION file.\n\nThen, how about the copyright/license information? Typically, like R packages, a Rust crate describes the license in the metadata. So, rather than actually concatenating all the license statements, I thought it’s enough to summarize the licenses. But, how? Writing R Extensions says:\n\nTo include comments about the licensing rather than the body of a license, use a file named something like LICENSE.note.\n\nso it seems this LICENSE.note is a good place for this. Actually, several CRAN packages use this file. So, I hope this works.\nThe details can be found in the following files:\n\ninst/AUTHORS\nLICENSE.note\nupdate_authors.R : R script to generate the above two files from the `Cargo.toml` of the dependency crates.\n\n\n\n3. downloads the pre-compiled binary without the agreement of the CRAN team\nRegarding this one, I have no idea how to do this properly.\nFirst, let’s go back to the sentence of the CRAN Policy:\n\nOnly as a last resort and with the agreement of the CRAN team should a package download pre-compiled software.\n\nYes, I believe it’s a “last resort.” My package tries to compile the Rust code first, and only when no Rust compiler is available on the machine, it falls back to downloading the pre-compiled binary. It downloads the fixed version of the binary and verifies the checksum.\nBut…, how can I get “the agreement”? What state is considered they agree on the use of pre-compiled binary?\nI explained above in the cran-comments.md on my latest submission, in the hope that they would manually review it so that the acceptance means the agreement on downloading. However, my package went to CRAN soon after it passed the auto checks. The manual review never happened. So, while my package is still on CRAN at the time of writing this, I’m not sure if that means the problem is fixed."

    "text": "Is CRAN suitable for Rust?\nHonestly, I was surprised that the CRAN Policy prohibits to rely on the standard mechanism of a language. At the same time, I do understand their stance. It’s a common conflict between the package managers.\nIn response to my email that mistakenly explained about the download mechanism (while the problem was not about how it downloads the binary), the CRAN maintainer wrote:\n\n&gt; That mechanism can be found in tools/configure.R.\n\nBut the comment in configure says that is for binary downloads. Your code is complicated, and I have spent far too long looking at it. As the CRAN policy says\n\n“The time of the volunteers is CRAN’s most precious resource”\n\nI’m really sorry that the maintainer had to read my messy code (although I never intended to force it). It’s almost impossible to check all the dependency management mechanism outside of R’s one no matter if it’s a major ecosystem like Rust or a minor tool like my script. So, I understand they need to be strict on this topic.\nFor example, Debian Rust Packaging Policy is stricter; it requires:\n\nPackage builds must not allow Cargo to access the network when building. In particular, they must not download or check out any sources at build time.\n\nIn Debian package’s case, if I understand correctly, it requires creating one Debian package per crate (but the packaging tool is provided so it shouldn’t be that difficult, I guess). Probably we can do the same thing on CRAN, but it feels a bit overkill.\nI still believe it’s possible to keep my package on CRAN, but I don’t casually recommend it to others. It requires considerable amount of efforts to comply with the CRAN Policy, at least at the moment."

    "text": "So…, should we give up on Rust?\nTo be clear, I don’t think so.\nIn the context of Debian package, the distro’s official repository is not the only way to distribute a Debian package. It can be distributed via unofficial PPA; it’s “unofficial” in the sense it’s not provided by the distro, but it can be “official” if the developers of the software officially maintain the PPA.\nFor another example, Emacs has the official repository, GNU ELPA. But, the users are not tied to it because there is the popular alternative, MELPA. GNU ELPA has strict requirements, but the users can enjoy MELPA at the same time.\nI think R needs such an alternative to CRAN. I’m expecting R-universe will eventually be what MELPA is to ELPA. That would be a good thing to CRAN, too. Much of the frustration that we currently feel about CRAN probably comes from the fact that CRAN takes on too much responsibility.\nI actually use R-universe to distribute a non-CRAN package using Rust, and it works fine. If you don’t try R-universe yet, I recommend it (probably I’ll write tutorial for R-universe if I can find time)."
