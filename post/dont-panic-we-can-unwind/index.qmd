Three months ago, I wrote [a blog post about R's protection mechanism and stack unwinding][post1].
In the post, I said:

[post1]: https://yutani.rbind.io/post/r-rust-protect-and-unwinding/

> Rust doesn't have `longjmp` / `setjmp` ([rust-lang/rfcs#2625][rfc]), so the last

[rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2625

But, soon after I published this, Lionel Henry kindly told me that we have 
another option; it's true that Rust doesn't have `longjmp`, but we can write a 
C function that does `longjmp` and call the function from Rust.

Disclaimer: I still don't have enough time to test these implementations, so
please read carefully. I might be wrong.

## What was the problem?

Let's summarise the last blog post quickly.
On error, the resources need to be freed before aborting. But,
different languages have different error handling mechanism, and it might not
work well to attempt to free resources beyond the language boundaries.

In order to solve this problem, R's C API provices `R_UnwindProtect()`,
which allows us to call a custom cleanup function before aborting. C++ can
utilize this to delay R's stack unwinding by escaping from it by `longjmp`
and then resuming by another API, `R_ContinueUnwind()`. But, as Rust desn't
support `longjmp`, Rust cannot implement such a custom cleanup function.
So, I concluded that, while it's not totally safe, we have no choice but
to use `panic!()` to escape from `R_UnwindProtect()`.

However, I was wrong.

## Overview

The basic idea is to write a C function that wraps `R_UnwindProtect()` and
escapes by `longjmp`, and call it from Rust's side. Rust then returns normally
instead of aborting so that the Rust's cleanup mechanism works. Returns what
to what? The continuous token for `R_ContinueUnwind()` to the C's side.

You might wonder what's "the C's side" mean, especially if you are familiar with
extendr framework. Yes, Rust functions can be called directly from R via FFI if
compiled so. However, to handle exceptions properly, we must use a C wrapper
function to call `R_ContinueUnwind()`.

One more thing that might be confusing is that we are going to write two C functions:

1. C function to be called from Rust (i.e., a wrapper around `R_UnwindProtect()`).
2. C function to be called from R session (i.e., a wrapper to inspect and handle the result from the Rust function)

## Implementation

### C function to be called from Rust

First, write a wrapper function of `R_UnwindProtect()`. The most of the code is derived from [cpp11][cpp11], so you can read cpp11 for the details.

[cpp11]: https://github.com/r-lib/cpp11/blob/eb4ff54a9764a95d024480e4ea81dc8bb2514c00/inst/include/cpp11/protect.hpp#L36-L75

```c
#include <setjmp.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include <Rinternals.h>

void not_so_long_jump(void *jmpbuf, Rboolean jump) {
    if (jump == TRUE) {
        longjmp(*(jmp_buf *)jmpbuf, 1);
    }
}

SEXP unwind_protect_impl(SEXP (*fun)(void *data), void *data) {
    SEXP token = R_MakeUnwindCont();
    R_PreserveObject(token);

    jmp_buf jmpbuf;
    if (setjmp(jmpbuf)) {
        // Tag the pointer
        return (SEXP)((uintptr_t)token | 1);
    }

    SEXP res = R_UnwindProtect(fun, data, not_so_long_jump, &jmpbuf, token);

    // Note: cpp11 says we need SETCAR(token, R_NilValue) here, but 
    // let's ignore it for now for simplicity.

    return res;
}
```

#### Tagged pointer

You might wonder what `| 1` does. This is a trick called
["tagged pointer"][tagged pointer], using a few of the least significant bits 
to store additional information. This time, the implementation uses the lowest
bit as an error flag.
[tagged pointer]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_pointer

Of course, tagged pointer is not the only answer. For example, you can probably
define a struct or enum to share the definition between Rust and C. But, I use
tagged `SEXP` because it's simpler in the sense it doesn't require additional
allocation.

Also note that I could just return `Result` here and create the tagged `SEXP`
later. It's just a matter of preferences.

#### `build.rs`

This C function needs to be compiled before compiling the Rust code because it's
needed at the linking stage. We can use `cc` crate to compile it in the build
script like this:

```rust
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    let r_include_dir =
        std::env::var("R_INCLUDE_DIR").expect("R_INCLUDE_DIR envvar must be provided.");

    cc::Build::new()
        .file("src/unwind_protect_wrapper.c")
        .include(Path::new(&r_include_dir))
        .compile("unwind_protect");

    println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed=src/unwind_protect_wrapper.c");
}
```

### Extern function definiton on Rust's side

To let Rust call the function, we need an `extern "C"` function definiton on 
Rust's side. Note that I'm not sure why the signature is this complex, but I
just use the result of bindgen as it is.

```rust
use libR_sys::SEXP;

extern "C" {
    fn unwind_protect_impl(
        fun: ::std::option::Option<unsafe extern "C" fn(data: *mut ::std::os::raw::c_void) -> SEXP>,
        data: *mut ::std::os::raw::c_void,
    ) -> SEXP;
}
```

### Rust function to call the C function

To actually call the above function from Rust code, we need an
implementation like below to call `unwind_protect(|| ...)`.
This code is derived from extendr's [`catch_r_error()`][extendr1].

[extendr1]: https://github.com/extendr/extendr/blob/a1f6bc0d06e881ffdc90248cdc5d3e9cfac170d9/extendr-api/src/thread_safety.rs#L112-L148

```rust
use libR_sys::SEXP;

#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum Error {
    UnexpectedType(String),
    Aborted(SEXP),
    Unknown,
}

pub type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, Error>;

pub unsafe fn unwind_protect<F>(f: F) -> Result<SEXP>
where
    F: FnOnce() -> SEXP + Copy,
{
    unsafe extern "C" fn do_call<F>(data: *mut std::os::raw::c_void) -> SEXP
    where
        F: FnOnce() -> SEXP + Copy,
    {
        let data = data as *const ();
        let f: &F = &*(data as *const F);
        f()
    }

    let fun_ptr = do_call::<F> as *const ();
    let fun = std::mem::transmute(fun_ptr);
    let data = std::mem::transmute(&f as *const F);
    let res: SEXP = unwind_protect_impl(fun, data);

    if (res as usize & 1) == 1 {
        return Err(Error::Aborted(res));
    }

    Ok(res)
}
```

### Rust function to handle the result

I use this function to handle various types of errors. But, in this post, we
only need to handle `Aborted` error, so this might be a bit overkill. Anyway,
the important point is that we must return the same type of result (in this 
case, `SEXP`) to C's side. Even when the actual function doesn't have any 
return values, we have to return some value like the one filled 
with `R_NilValue`.

This is because the final error handling (e.g., raising an error by
`Rf_error()`, and resuming the aborted unwinding by `R_ContinueUnwind()`) is
done on C's side in this design. No return value means there's no way to know
whether calling the Rust function succeeded or not.

```rust
pub fn handle_result(result: Result<SEXP>) -> SEXP {
    match result {
        Ok(res) => res,

        Err(e) => match e {
            // The token is already tagged, so pass it as it is.
            Error::Aborted(token) => token,

            // In other cases, return the error string with the tag
            e => unsafe {
                let msg = e.to_string();
                let r_error = Rf_mkCharLenCE(
                    msg.as_ptr() as *const i8,
                    msg.len() as i32,
                    cetype_t_CE_UTF8,
                );

                // set the error flag
                (r_error as usize | 1) as SEXP
            },
        },
    }
}
```

### C function to handle the result

Let's look at the C's side then. Again, as I described above, I use a
tagged `SEXP` to indicate the error, but you can use any data structure.
The point here is that a wrapper function like this must be implemented
to handle unwinding. To handle errors from Rust code, you can raise an
error in the R wrapper function instead of C. But, `R_ContinueUnwind()`
cannot be called from R code, so this has to be done at C-level.

```c
static uintptr_t TAGGED_POINTER_MASK = (uintptr_t)1;

SEXP handle_result(SEXP res_) {
    uintptr_t res = (uintptr_t)res_;

    // An error is indicated by tag.
    if ((res & TAGGED_POINTER_MASK) == 1) {
        // Remove tag
        SEXP res_aligned = (SEXP)(res & ~TAGGED_POINTER_MASK);

        // Currently, there are two types of error cases:
        //
        //   1. Error from Rust code
        //   2. Error from R's C API, which is caught by R_UnwindProtect()
        //
        if (TYPEOF(res_aligned) == CHARSXP) {
            // In case 1, the result is an error message that can be passed to
            // Rf_error() directly.
            Rf_error("%s", CHAR(res_aligned));
        } else {
            // In case 2, the result is the token to restart the
            // cleanup process on R's side.
            R_ContinueUnwind(res_aligned);
        }
    }

    return (SEXP)res;
}
```
