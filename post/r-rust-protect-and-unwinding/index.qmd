In the recent half a year, I've been [struggling to understand how the extendr
framework works](https://github.com/yutannihilation/unextendr). One of the
things I found is that it's extremely hard to protect and unprotect R objects
properly from Rust's side. Let me share my incomplete knowledges.

(Disclaimer: I'm not an expert around here. My explanations and terms might be inaccurate or incorrect.)

## Protect

First, let's talk about how to protect R objects. Protect from what? From the
garbage collection (GC) mechanism of R. [Writing R
Extension](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Garbage-Collection)
(WRE) says:

> The memory allocated for R objects is not freed by the user; instead, the
memory is from time to time garbage collected. That is, some or all of the
allocated memory not being used is freed or marked as re-usable.

So, we have to claim the objects we use are in use, otherwise they might be
accidentally freed while we are using it, which will causes serious problems.
As far as I know, there are mainly 3 ways to do this "protection".

### `PROTECT()` (or `Rf_protect()`)

The most basic one is the `PROTECT()` macro. WRE says:

> If you create an R object in your C code, you must tell R that you are using
the object by using the `PROTECT` macro on a pointer to the object. This tells R
that the object is in use so it is not destroyed during garbage collection

`PROTECT()` takes an `SEXP` and returns the `SEXP`, so you can use this like the
following example on WRE:

```c
SEXP ab;
ab = PROTECT(allocVector(REALSXP, 2));
REAL(ab)[0] = 123.45;
REAL(ab)[1] = 67.89;
```

You can also use `PROTECT()` in a separate line.

```c
SEXP ab;
ab = allocVector(REALSXP, 2);
PROTECT(ab);
REAL(ab)[0] = 123.45;
REAL(ab)[1] = 67.89;
```

Wow, super simple. Now that it gets protected, we've all done, right? Well, no.
You have to remove that `PROTECT()`ion when it gets no longer needed, otherwise
your memory will be exhausted.

This can be done by `UNPROTECT()`. So, the full function definition would be like this:

```c
SEXP new_real2() {
    SEXP ab;
    ab = PROTECT(allocVector(REALSXP, 2));

    REAL(ab)[0] = 123.45;
    REAL(ab)[1] = 67.89;

    UNPROTECT(1);
    return ab;
}
```

Here, you might wonder why `UNPROTECT()` takes an integer while the
corresponding function `PROTECT()` takes an `SEXP`. This is because the
protection mechanism is stack-based. WRE says:

> The protection mechanism is stack-based, so `UNPROTECT(n)` unprotects the
last `n` objects which were protected.

`UNPROTECT()` can unprotect only from the top of the stack. This means you
cannot do something like "let's return an object with protection and unprotect
later in another function." If something gets `PROTECT()`ed in a function, it's
required to be `UNPROTECT()` within the function. WRE says:

> Calls to `PROTECT` and `UNPROTECT` should balance in each function. A function
may only call `UNPROTECT` or `REPROTECT` on objects it has itself protected.

I don't know well about the design of data structures, but I guess the
advantages of being stack-based are

* fast
* can be unwound (WRE says: "Note that the pointer protection stack balance is restored automatically on non-local transfer of control (..snip..) as if a call to `UNPROTECT` was invoked with the right argument.")

### `R_PreserveObject()`

While the rule of `PROTECT()` requires as above, we certainly have many valid
cases that are not covered by this:

1. We want the object to live among multiple function calls
2. We want the object to live forever (i.e., until the R session ends)

An example of case 1 is to wrap `SEXP` objects in a C++ class, which should
protect in its constructor and unprotect in its destructor (how to call the
destructor properly is another headache, but let's discuss later).

Fortunately, R provides `R_PreserveObject()` and the corresponding function
`R_ReleaseObject()` for this. WRE says:

> a call to `R_PreserveObject` adds an object to an internal list of objects not
to be collects, and a subsequent call to `R_ReleaseObject` removes it from that
list. This provides a way for objects which are not returned as part of R
objects to be protected across calls to compiled code

So, it sounds like `R_PreserveObject()` supersedes `PROTECT()`. Why not use it
all the time?? Well, while `R_PreserveObject()` is great, it's slow. WRE says:

> It is less efficient than the normal protection mechanism, and should be used
sparingly.

Why slow? This is because how it's implemented. The explanation in [the related
performance issue][Rcpp-issue] says:

[Rcpp-issue]: https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp/issues/1081

> This is a simple linked list, so has to be searched linearly to remove objects
pushed on early.

So, are there any efficient ways to provide protection longer than one function
call? The answer is simple. To prevent an `SEXP` from being considered as
unused, we can actually use it!

### Get referenced by another `SEXP`

WRE says:

> Protecting an R object automatically protects all the R objects pointed to in
the corresponding `SEXPREC`, for example all elements of a protected list are
automatically protected. 

To put this into simpler words, if an R object already belongs to another R
object (e.g., an element of a `list`), it doesn't need the protection of
`PROTECT()` or `R_PreserveObject()`. Actually, that's why functions are supposed
to return unprotected results; on the R session, the returned value is
immediately assinged to a variable in some environment.

We can utilize this spec in several ways. A straightforward implementation of
this is to have one big `R_PreserveObject()`ed list as the "anchor" and assign R
objects to it. extendr uses this way ([code][extendr-code]). But, if this is
done naively, it would also be inefficient as `R_ReleaseObject()` to search
linearly which one to unprotect. So, extendr uses a hashmap nicely. Another
reason of hashmap is that extendr allows `Clone`, so it must track the reference
count on Rust's side as well, but let's not talk about the details here.

[extendr-code]: https://github.com/extendr/extendr/blob/ca001033e371ff3f52022cea72aa534f2958f041/extendr-api/src/ownership.rs#L60-L61

More sophisticated example is cpp11. It uses a doubly-linked-list approach
([code][cpp11-code]), which is based on the suggestion in [the
issue][Rcpp-issue] above. This is more efficient when unprotecting. The C++ code
is a bit advanced, so [my naive implementation in Rust][unextendr-code] might be
a bit easier to read.

[cpp11-code]: https://github.com/r-lib/cpp11/blob/3c877986ce886b320ceafb853358d856f07834f4/inst/include/cpp11/protect.hpp#L431-L433
[unextendr-code]: https://github.com/yutannihilation/unextendr/blob/master/src/rust/src/protect.rs

### When to use which?

In summary, we have mainly 3 options to protect:

1. `PROTECT()`
2. `R_PreserveObject()`
3. Get refrenced by another `SEXP`

You might wonder if we should always use case 3. But, if you look at the
implementation of cpp11, it will easily remind you that `PROTECT()` is needed
anyway until the object gets referenced. If you care about efficiency, you
should use `PROTECT()` when it's enough.

In my understanding, ideally we should

1. Use `PROTECT()` everywhere as long as the protection is needed within the function
2. Use `R_PreserveObject()` for objects that are never released during the R session
3. Use the doubly-linked list when an object needs protection longer than one function call but shorter than one R session

This topic still has more room to discuss, but let's move on as this is not the
main one of this post!

## Unwinding and `longjmp`

What is unwinding? Honestly, I'm not confident what exactly this term refers to,
but it seems it's a cleanup process when some exception happens. For example,
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#Unwinding) says:

> Returning from the called function will pop the top frame off the stack,
perhaps leaving a return value. The more general act of popping one or more
frames off the stack to resume execution elsewhere in the program is called
**stack unwinding** and must be performed when non-local control structures are
used, such as those used for exception handling.

Usually, this explanation should be satisfying. But, as I'm talking about Rust,
things are a bit more complicated. "non-local control structures" means
`panic!()` to Rust, which we don't try to catch in usual cases. Yes..., this is
the core of the problem I'm writing. Let's revisit later.

### Different languages have different unwinding mechanism

Let's forget about Rust. Suppose we want to use C++.

C++ and Rust are the same in that it has difficulty to handle `longjmp`. C++'s
class has destructor, which is called when the object is deleted. So, in theory,
a C++ class of a wrapper of an R object can manage the protection with including
the unprotecting operation in its destructor.

However, the problem is that, the destructor can be called only in C++'s
exception handling. If some R error, which is implemented using `longjmp`,
happens on calling R's C APIs, the destructor is not called. More details can be
found the following blog post by the R core member:

[Use of C++ in Packages - The R Blog](https://blog.r-project.org/2019/03/28/use-of-c-in-packages/index.html)

> Unfortunately, RAII does not work with setjmp/longjmp functions provided by
the C runtime for exception handling.

### `R_UnwindProtect()`

Fortunately, R's C API provides a function for this, `R_UnwindProtect()`. This
is something like `tryCatch()` at the C-level. The signature is:

```c
SEXP R_UnwindProtect(SEXP (*fun)(void *data), void *data,
                     void (*clean)(void *data, Rboolean jump), void *cdata,
                     SEXP cont);
```

Basically, this is to wrap `fun(data)`. If a `longjmp` error happens during the
execution of `fun(data)`, `clean(cdata, TRUE)` will be called before actually
doing `longjmp`.

In the C++'s case, it is intended to throw C++ exception in `clean()` to let
C++'s stack unwinding happen first. Then, `R_ContinueUnwind(cont)` can be used
for moving back to C's (or R's) exception handling. `cont` is an R object
created by `R_MakeUnwindCont()`.

For a real example, cpp11's implemntation is ([code][cpp11-code2]):

[cpp11-code2]: https://github.com/r-lib/cpp11/blob/3c36f7f48a4998c0cd0abb2fc964b24393eafe21/inst/include/cpp11/protect.hpp#L90-L115

```cpp
  static SEXP token = [] {
    SEXP res = R_MakeUnwindCont();
    R_PreserveObject(res);
    return res;
  }();

  std::jmp_buf jmpbuf;
  if (setjmp(jmpbuf)) {
    should_unwind_protect = TRUE;
    throw unwind_exception(token);
  }

  SEXP res = R_UnwindProtect(
      [](void* data) -> SEXP {
        auto callback = static_cast<decltype(&code)>(data);
        return static_cast<Fun&&>(*callback)();
      },
      &code,
      [](void* jmpbuf, Rboolean jump) {
        if (jump == TRUE) {
          // We need to first jump back into the C++ stacks because you can't safely
          // throw exceptions from C stack frames.
          longjmp(*static_cast<std::jmp_buf*>(jmpbuf), 1);
        }
      },
      &jmpbuf, token);
```

Note that this is a bit more complex than what WRE describes. As the comment
says, this first jumps into the C++ stack by `longjmp()`, and throws the C++
exception there (the `if` branch with `setjmp()`). The error is caught by a
`try-catch` block like this (a simplefied version of [this original
code][cpp11-code3]):

[cpp11-code3]: https://github.com/r-lib/cpp11/blob/3c36f7f48a4998c0cd0abb2fc964b24393eafe21/inst/include/cpp11/declarations.hpp#L32-L52

```cpp
SEXP err = R_NilValue
try {

  // ...snip...

}
catch (cpp11::unwind_exception & e) {
  err = e.token
  R_ContinueUnwind(err);
}
```

### So, what about Rust?

Okay, let's come back to Rust. 
Rust also has destructor (i.e., `Drop` trait), so we'll face the same problem.
Can we survive with the same approach as C++?

Yes and no. Rust has a kind of try-catch,
[`std::panic::catch_unwind()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html)
while its document says:

> It is not recommended to use this function for a general try/catch mechanism.

So..., it's kind of possible. Actually, extendr uses `catch_unwind()`
([code][extendr-code2]). In the code below, the cleanup function `do_cleanup()`
calls `panic!()`, which is caught by `catch_unwind()`.

[extendr-code2]: https://github.com/extendr/extendr/blob/ca001033e371ff3f52022cea72aa534f2958f041/extendr-api/src/thread_safety.rs#L105-L148

```rust
pub fn catch_r_error<F>(f: F) -> Result<SEXP>
where
    F: FnOnce() -> SEXP + Copy,
    F: std::panic::UnwindSafe,
{
    // ...snip...

    unsafe extern "C" fn do_cleanup(_: *mut raw::c_void, jump: Rboolean) {
        if jump != 0 {
            panic!("R has thrown an error.");
        }
    }

    unsafe {
        let fun_ptr = do_call::<F> as *const ();
        let clean_ptr = do_cleanup as *const ();
        let x = false;
        let fun = std::mem::transmute(fun_ptr);
        let cleanfun = std::mem::transmute(clean_ptr);
        let data = std::mem::transmute(&f);
        let cleandata = std::mem::transmute(&x);
        let cont = R_MakeUnwindCont();
        Rf_protect(cont);

        // Note that catch_unwind does not work for 32 bit windows targets.
        let res = match std::panic::catch_unwind(|| {
            R_UnwindProtect(fun, data, cleanfun, cleandata, cont)
        }) {
            Ok(res) => Ok(res),
            Err(_) => Err("Error in protected R code".into()),
        };
        Rf_unprotect(1);
        res
    }
}
```

In general, `panic!()` should be avoided when the Rust function is called over
FFI. `panic!()` causes unwinding, and cross-language unwinding is considered as
undefined behavior (cf., [Rust "ffi-unwind" project -
FAQ](https://github.com/rust-lang/project-ffi-unwind/blob/master/faq.md)).

However, the problem is, we have to jump. We must escape from the cleanup
function. Otherwise, `R_ContinueUnwind(cont)` will be called ([code][R code])
automatically.

[R code]: https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/e29a22b8faf9c329ad4aafc2a0823666d43d1d84/src/main/context.c#L970-L973

```c
    cleanfun(cleandata, jump);

    if (jump)
        R_ContinueUnwind(cont); 
```

Rust doesn't have `longjmp` / `setjmp` ([rust-lang/rfcs#2625][rfc]), so the last
resort is `panic!()`. While we know it's not good, there's no option left as far
as I know.

[rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2625

**(Update: [I found I was wrong. We can get rid of `panic!()`](https://yutani.rbind.io/post/dont-panic-we-can-unwind/))**

I'm honestly not sure the current extendr's implementation is really safe, but
it seems we anyway need a similar implementation to get things work. (However, I
think it's probably a mistake that it doesn't call `R_ContinueUnwind(cont)` to
resume the unwinding process on C's side.)

## My take

I'm concluding unwinding cannot be done correctly only with Rust. My take is

- Rust functions should catch all R errors by `R_UnwindProtect()`.

- Rust functions should not use `panic!()` and `panic_unwind()` as a substitute
for try-catch, but it seems there's no other options.

- Rust functions should never call `Rf_errorcall()` directly. Instead, it should
return the error information to the C wrapper function, and accordingly the C
function should call `Rf_errorcall()` (or `R_ContinueUnwind()`). Note that this
is because it's also possible to throw an error at R-level, but
`R_ContinueUnwind()` is only possible at C-level.
